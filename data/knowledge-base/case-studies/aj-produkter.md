## At a glance

- Centralized Marketing Operations: AJ Produkter implemented Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform (CMP) to centralize and streamline their marketing operations across 20 European markets. Before adopting CMP, the company managed marketing efforts through fragmented communication channels which led to inefficiencies and siloed workflows. The CMP provided a unified platform that enabled AJ Produkter to organize and orchestrate all marketing tasks in one place, ensuring consistency and coordination across all regions.
- Enhanced Workflow Efficiency: The CMP facilitated the creation of a structured task backlog, allowing teams to easily track and follow marketing workflows. This structured approach helped different teams within the organization to collaborate more effectively, breaking down silos and promoting cross-functional teamwork. By simplifying the process and updating the platform three times, AJ Produkter ensured that their marketing operations remained efficient and agile
- Improved Content Management: Optimizely's CMP allowed AJ Produkter to tag, organize, and visualize marketing campaigns with fields and labels, making it easy to find and manage content. This capability enabled the creation of comprehensive marketing and activity plans that could be visualized across different levels of the organization. The centralized system replaced the use of disparate tools like Excel, Sheets, and PowerPoints, consolidating all information into one accessible platform. The CMP also improved communication and collaboration among teams, leading to higher quality content production and a more enjoyable work environment for team members.
- Future Integration and Experimentation: AJ Produkter plans to further develop the CMP by integrating it with their CMS for smoother content publishing and exploring connections to other marketing channels, including YouTube and social media. The CMP will also be a crucial tool for AJ Produkter's future experimentation plans, helping them to plan and execute experiments more effectively. By continuing to enhance the platform, AJ Produkter aims to maintain high levels of efficiency and innovation in their marketing efforts, supporting their growth and adaptation in the competitive market.
