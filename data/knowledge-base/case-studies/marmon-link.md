# Marmon Link increases page views and unique visitors

Marmon Link moves beyond a website to transformative experiences with Optimizely
B2B Commerce Cloud

## A new name and a sharpened focus on customers

They’ve got a new name but they’re just as focused (if not more) on their
customers as they were when they were founded as 3Wire in 2001. Marmon Link is
an industry leading foodservice and beverage replacement parts distributor.
They’re committed to providing the highest quality products and services to food
and beverage customers coast-to-coast.

Marmon Link offers the single biggest selection of replacement parts, technical
support and customer service – for Marmon-branded equipment, supporting industry
leading brands such as Cornelius, Prince Castle and Silver King. The company’s
genuine Marmon-branded OEM parts go through vigorous testing and extensive
quality assurance. The team is highly efficient and works to ensure the highest
customer satisfaction.

## Rising up to the challenge and beating the competition

One of the biggest challenges in the food and beverage industry is that it‘s
difficult to anticipate order needs. While other industries have predictive
models for replacement needs, Marmon Link customers do not always know when they
will need parts for their equipment. When the need arises, the need is
immediate. That means suppliers like Marmon Link must have the inventory
available and have the ability to deliver parts as soon as humanly possible.

In order to keep up with competition and meet customers’ immediate needs for
replacement parts, Marmon Link knew they had to completely transform the buying
experience. They needed to build a distinct digital advantage over their
competition or they’d lose customers.

## A marketing-led charge

Marmon Link concluded they needed a complete revamp of their user experience to
keep up. Where to turn? Website, eCommerce and integration projects are often
led by IT professionals or c-suite leaders. However, a different player stepped
up to the plate for Marmon Link.

We’re seeing more and more eCommerce projects being led by strong marketing
leaders, and Jennie Stenback, VP Marketing and eCommerce at Marmon Link was just
the person for the job.

From the beginning, Stenback knew that this went far beyond a website. She
called it a transformational initiative; allowing for the unique complexities
inherent in B2B environments. And she knew it would require an entire company
shift, not just a website.

The marketing-led transformation needed buy-in across the organization and with
their customers. Cross-functional team development was critical. In Marmon
Link’s case key players in eCommerce included marketing, project management, IT,
ERP strategists, business analysts, customer care, finance, logistics and sales.
They needed their frontline sales representatives and Customer Service
Representatives on board to help interpret what their customers were demanding
from their buying journeys.

## From a turnkey solution to a scalable one

The base eCommerce platform Marmon Link originally had in place was rigid and
not customizable. Even more challenging, the original platform was blind to
search engines on the most critical elements of parts inventory. Marmon Link
needed a technology that could scale and grow with the business and enabled them
to build an enhanced and modern user experience – allowing for the unique
complexities of B2B.

The Marmon Link team needed to find a solution that could accomplish the
following:

- Service both businesses and individual customers
- Out-of-the-box B2B functionality
- Considerable customizability
- Marriage between a B2B purchasing environment and a B2C-type frontend
- Improve overall UX
- Align with modernized processes and policies
- Accommodate freight programming and simplified pricing models

Marmon Link chose the Optimizely Configured Commerce because of its flexibility
and robustness. Leveraging the platform, Marmon Link launched multiple websites,
each serving complex customer needs. The websites manage integrated search
engine results and flexible platform modifications for a vastly improved
customer experience.

## Transformational results

After implementing Optimizely Configured Commerce, Marmon Link made immediate
progress toward ROI. They’re converting more users, gaining new customers and
are a force to be reckoned with in the marketplace.

Marmon Link has seen significant increases across the board, including seeing an
increase in page views and unique visitors.
