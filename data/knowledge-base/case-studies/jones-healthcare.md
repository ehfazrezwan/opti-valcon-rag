## Innovation, transformation and a legacy built on trust

In 1882, Henry Jones founded a company with a single mission: to serve the
people of the Canadian pharmacy market with the highest quality products and
service. Henry promised that when it came to deadlines, quality, price and
service, he would always keep his word. He left a legacy built on trust.

137 years and four generations later, Jones Healthcare Group has never wavered
from Henry’s legacy. Though they’ve changed and transformed from an apothecary
packaging provider to a fully integrated and award-winning provider of premier
packaging and medication-dispensing solutions, over the years one thing has
always remained true: Jones sees the people behind the businesses they serve.

To thrive for more than a century, you have to innovate along the way. Today,
Jones serves more than 12,000 pharmacies across the world through its Healthcare
division and is committed to not only providing outstanding service and end-to-
end packaging solutions, but also simplifying the process. So when their
healthcare customers asked for more efficient ways to buy, Jones rose to the
challenge without hesitation.

We had talked to a lot of other providers that met some of our requirements. It
seemed like they could maybe get where we needed them to be, but we didn’t
really have confidence. But with Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, the
functionality we needed was all there. It wasn’t some customization we had to
build. Our requirements were met right out of the box.

## Serving customers well into the future

The medical manufacturing industry swiftly evolved overtime. As technology
advanced, Jones recognized a shift in their customers’ preferences. Jones knew
that in order to make their customers jobs easier, they needed to provide more
efficient ways to manage the ordering process. So, they ventured into eCommerce
to prepare their business for the future.

In order to validate their approach, Jones first conducted customer research to
determine whether the need for a more robust online solution was something their
customers would actually utilize.

The results of Jones’ survey proved the Jones team’s hypothesis right. Here are
some of the key highlights:

- Jones customers were familiar with online ordering and conducted business online with other companies
- 80.67% of customer respondents said they would find an online ordering system either very valuable or extremely valuable
- Customers wanted eCommerce because they believed an online ordering system would be quicker, easier and available 24/7
- Customers wanted features including real-time order/shipping status, tracking and re-order, eCatalogue – pictures, descriptions, customer specific pricing of all products, account and order history

So, Jones had their answer. Customers wanted eCommerce. They wanted a
frictionless order experience.

## The hunt for the right eCommerce fit

After establishing their goals, vision, strategy and team, Jones began their
search for the right eCommerce engine to power the healthcare experience. Jones’
key eCommerce requirements included:

- Account login/accessibility
- Integration with their SAP ERP
- Real-time order status/history
- Reordering capabilities
- Promotions capabilities
- Frictionless checkout process
- Unique user profiles
- Catalog capability for generic, branded and custom SKUs

## An emphasis on product content

As they journeyed through their transformation, Jones quickly realized their
product portfolio was disorganized. It was hard to recognize part numbers and
there was no methodology for categorization. As part of the transformation to
get their product catalog online, Jones had to organize their portfolio into
product categories, details, groups and provide product images from multiple
angles. This process proved to be a period of self-discovery. Now, the team has
a far better understanding of their entire product catalog because the project
went beyond eCommerce, driving a broader business discussion.

The Jones portfolio includes three kinds of products:

- Generic, agnostic products, consumed by any pharmacy
- Branded products that are tied to a specific pharmacy brand (equivalent to CVS or Walgreens)
- Customized products for small pharmacies

Jones has anywhere from 600 (in-stock products) to up to 10,000 custom SKUs.
Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud was able to accommodate the complexities involved
in multiple product types.

## The new world with Optimizely

Before implementing Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, the old buying process for
Jones looked something like this: _a customer would call and say, I’m Jim at
Jim’s pharmacy and I want my labels. That would form the PO._ Jones wanted to
move that conversation online. Today Jim can go login to his account, view his
information, reorder and self-serve. Plus, in the previous model Jim would
simply have to trust that Jones knew what labels he needed. Today, as part of
the online solution, Jim can physically see his labels before he orders. Plus,
Jim only sees what he needs to see. He doesn’t get bombarded with products that
are irrelevant to his business. The online solution is not only making customers
more efficient, it’s building confidence.

_Optimizely helps Jones increase share of wallet._

In addition to building customer efficiency and confidence, eCommerce is helping
Jones increase their share of wallet by enabling the team to proactively cross-
sell and upsell to customers. There are about 10,000 pharmacies across Canada
and most of them carry Jones products. Jones already has solid market
penetration. But historically, they didn’t have an eCommerce platform that
enabled them to clearly display their entire offering to customers. Now
customers are more aware of Jones’ entire product catalog and average order
value is continually increasing.

_Optimizely aids Jones with data hygiene._

When customers register for the online solution, they must provide valid account
information. The portal is helping Jones to gather customer information and
improve their data hygiene. Customers are opting in and giving Jones their
consent to send them marketing messages.

**Jones hits year-one eCommerce goals one week after national launch**

Just three months after their soft launch and one week after their national
launch, Jones had already exceeded their year-one goals for eCommerce.
Originally, Jones set out to get 10% of their individual store orders online in
year one. One week after the national launch of their eCommerce platform, they
had already seen over 15% online. In addition, they aimed for 1,000 registered
users at the end of year one. One week after national launch, they had more than
1,100 registered users.

Though they’ve focused their eCommerce experience on individual stores (which
make up 40% of their customer base), Jones also sells through wholesalers. About
60% of their business comes through large EDI orders from wholesalers. Early
success metrics have validated the importance and value of eCommerce for Jones’
customers. The company has received nothing but positive feedback. Even
customers who don’t place orders online have found value in simply browsing the
catalog and product information.

Beyond the benefits at the individual store level, the online catalog has become
a system of reference for the wholesalers Jones serves. Wholesale part numbers
are available and product data is plentiful.

Jones has been collecting customer feedback about the online solution. Here are
just a few quotes from their customers about the experience:

- “The Pharmacy Store has made ordering pharmacy supplies significantly easier for me and my team.”
- “Items are easier to find and I like how the photos make is easy to identify products.”
- “The ability to upload an order without having to search for items is a time-saving feature we’ve been using.”
- “Favorites Lists make finding the products we need easy – without searching.”

Because Jones already achieved their goals for year one just one week after
national launch, the team is bringing their year two and three goals forward.
Initially they aimed to have 25% of their individual store orders online. Given
their success, they are marching toward 25% by year one and 35-40% by year two.
There are 10,000 pharmacies that use Jones products. What’s the endgame? To have
10,000 pharmacies registered with Jones online.
