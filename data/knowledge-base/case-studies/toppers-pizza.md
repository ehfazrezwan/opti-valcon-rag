# Toppers Pizza dish up tasty customer experiences

## The challenge

Toppers Pizza are noted as one of the fastest growing pizza chains in the US.
Covering 15 States with near 80 physical stores. They're notorious for their
delicious taste and fresh ingredients.

The Challenge

Experiencing over 50% of orders taking place online, Toppers Pizza (Toppers)
wanted to take a proactive step in excelling customer needs. They sought to
transform their existing customer experience by building a foundation of
technology-driven innovation. The food retailers’ objectives were to;

- Create a cloud-based Point of Sale (POS)
- A commerce-enabled website
- increase revenue through these channels
- Improve engagement with customers

What stood out about Optimizely when choosing e-commerce solutions was its ease-
of-use and out-of-box capabilities. We needed a prepackaged tool that we could
customize, and we wanted something with enterprise capabilities in an easy-to-
use system that would help empower our marketing team, help eliminate the
technical debt we’ve accumulated, and reduce our time to market.

## The solution

To successfully execute these objectives, Toppers appointed Optimizely Premium
Partner Rightpoint.

The teams created two new areas to realize Toppers ambition, all to be built on
the Optimizely Digital Experience Platform.

The first area was a commerce infrastructure that would support online
transactions. The second was a custom-built POS across its physical estate. The
two areas would be integrated in enabling automatic re-ordering functions the
aid the supply-chain.

Both areas were to be hosted on Microsoft Azure, giving Toppers real-time data
insight and the flexibility to update promotions & pricing across all customer
engagement points with the ability to easily scale to high traffic demands.

## The Outcome

Customers using their user-profile, now had a seamless journey - whether online
or offline when it came to ordering. Optimizely's stable yet powerful platform
unlocked rich data for Toppers improving store efficiency. Each Toppers store
has access to real-time insights about how much time a new order takes from
input, to baking, to load time. In addition, an innovative new GPS-routing map
shows exactly where all the deliveries are located. All Toppers delivery drivers
now venture out in the most efficient way possible. The multitude of newly
delivered benefits all contribute to an even better customer experience with
Toppers.
