## Building a center of excellence

HP is in the early stages of their journey towards creating a true culture of
experimentation throughout their organization. HP also knows that increasing the
pace of innovation for their campaigns will be essential to ensuring peak
performance for various digital business units that have started doing
experimentation, including their B2C online store, HP.com website, B2B
e-commerce organization, Instant Ink organization and Customer Support site.

HP has invested in creating a program around experimentation, building a more
robust process for ideation, prioritization, development, execution and post-
campaign analysis. HP shares learnings with business stakeholders throughout the
organization in their weekly program reporting meeting and are also planning to
roll out a weekly newsletter to help share updates and findings across their
teams.

HP’s ultimate goal is to give every employee the chance to experiment and gather
data around their ideas. The center of excellence is exploring ways to help
scale HP’s testing program sustainably. As a result of their focus on
experimentation, they’ve been able to run almost 500 campaigns and have driven
an incremental $21 million in revenue with Optimizely.

## Data-driven thinking drives experimentation

Here are some example tests that HP’s center of excellence has overseen:

- HP’s omnichannel team wanted to see if shoppers were more responsive to certain resellers vs. others. They added Best Buy, Amazon and Staples links and then tracked orders to see which were driving the most online sales. This data helped HP figure out how to most effectively work with partners.
- HP’s Instant Ink subscription service experimented with different enrollment offers. The experiment involved showing customers an option for a free trial and positioning the service as a printer feature. The experiment increased enrollment by 37%.
- The eCommerce UX team redesigned its printer category page and conducted a 50/50 split test of the old page vs. the new one. The new page increased success metrics by 20% and yielded an incremental $260K per quarter.
