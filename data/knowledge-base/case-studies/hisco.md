# Hisco sees 80% fewer touch points required per online order

## All hands on deck for an evolving sales model

A specialty distributor serving the electronic assembly, aerospace and defense,
medical, electronics and other industrial markets, Hisco strives for continuous
improvement in every aspect of their business. Whether it’s service,
warehousing, automated inventory, packaging or shipping solutions, they strive
for the highest customer satisfaction possible. When customers’ needs started
evolving, Hisco invested in ecommerce.

Traditionally, Hisco was a very field sales driven organization. They didn’t
have a very large ecommerce presence. They never intended to replace their sales
model, instead they looked to ecommerce to augment their sales approach.

## Early success and continuous improvement based on customer feedback

Since launching Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, Hisco has seen an 8.1 percent
increase in year-over-year online orders. The transformation has resulted in 80
percent fewer touch points required per online order. Hisco is building higher
efficiencies by enabling their customers to self-serve. Hisco continues to look
for ways they can improve their website through voice of the customer surveys,
sales team feedback and reporting efforts.
