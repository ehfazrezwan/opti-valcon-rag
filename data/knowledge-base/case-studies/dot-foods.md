## Pioneers with big dreams of streamlining the food supply chain

In 1960, Robert and Dorothy Tracy founded Associated Dairy Products Company (now
Dot Foods) out of the back of their family’s station wagon. They dreamed of
giving customers access to affordable products and helping food industry
suppliers increase their sales.

60 years and three generations of Tracy family leaders later, Dot Foods has
transformed the food industry and is the largest food industry redistribution
company in North America.

Dot Foods owes its success to their business model, shared values, the talents
of 6,400 employees and the Tracy family’s leadership. Dot Foods is considered a
B2B food service leader and serves as a much-needed “buy by the truck-load”
food-supply partner sitting in between food manufacturers like P&G, Kellogg’s,
General Mills, etc. and consumer channels.

Today, Dot Foods makes more products accessible to more people than ever before
and is hyper-focused on driving growth. To differentiate, Dot Foods looked to
embark on a digital transformation journey and own their entire distribution
network. Dot Foods partnered with Optimizely and Valtech to engineer new
experiences for the end-user that would change the way the promise of shared
growth was delivered to their customers.

## From simple transactions to customer-centric experiences

Dot Foods’ initial ecommerce portal was a simple transactional site. Dot Foods
knew that in order to transform, they had to change their focus to putting the
customer at the center of the experience. Dot Foods wanted to serve their
customers in more meaningful ways online by being more transparent, proactive
and anticipating their needs. Ultimately, Dot Foods strived to deliver an
ecommerce experience that went beyond transactions and served as a trusted
companion to their customers.

Migrating to Optimizely enabled Dot Foods to take advantage of the benefits of a
leading digital experience platform and swiftly respond to evolving customer
expectations. They are now able to activate all moments across the customer
journey. Plus, they can move extremely quickly as evidenced by their ability to
deploy a COVID-19 microsite featuring alternative, high-demand COVID-19
products, in a manner of just two weeks.

## The big dreams continue with goals to triple online revenue

This may sound strange coming from a technology provider, but it’s not always
enough to just throw technology at a problem. Companies who embark on digital
transformation journeys must not be afraid of culture or mindset shifts. Dot
Foods created a company-wide mindset around ecommerce to rally around goals
including:

- Introduce an intuitive, contextual and inspiring ecommerce experience
- Bring all channels together in one digital interface
- Deliver shared growth to customers
- Increase online sales from $1 billion to $3 billion

"I am extremely proud that we could generate the kind of business lift we did
for Dot Foods with the COVID-19 microsite built on Optimizely, in a matter of
just two weeks."
