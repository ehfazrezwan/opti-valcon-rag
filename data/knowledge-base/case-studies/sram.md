# SRAM gets a digital tune up through a new consumer-facing site

## Digital upcycling

Founded in Chicago, IL in 1987, SRAM has grown to be one of the world's largest
bicycle component manufacturers and one of the most recognized and trusted
brands with cyclists worldwide. SRAM designs and manufactures high-end bicycle
components, including shifters, derailleurs, brakes, chains, suspension, power
meters, and other cycling parts.

While SRAM had the ability to digitally enable their robust network of bike
manufacturers, distributors, and retail partners through an Optimizely-based B2B
digital commerce site, they knew they had an opportunity with their B2C site to
expand their market reach, own their brand experience from start to finish, and
better understand their customers’ buying patterns and needs.

Looking for a partner with deep technical expertise, SRAM chose to work with
BlueBolt on their B2C project. BlueBolt developed the solution on the Optimizely
Commerce platform, leveraging the brand’s previously implemented B2B site and
infrastructure to create an experience that demonstrates the excellence of the
SRAM brand, while providing not only a way for customers to purchase, but also
to learn more about SRAM products through rich content.

## Project objectives

- A redesigned site experience on desktop and mobile to enable a frictionless research and buying journey across the site, including a shared shopping cart across brands.
- Implement a custom configurator specific to the Quarq product site, which enables a user to build their chosen product directly on the product detail page. This is a unique customization within Optimizely that takes any number of SKU’s and drills down options based on the buyer’s selections, to deliver one final finished product and price.
- Provide refreshed brand experiences for Quarq and Zipp, with the addition of the “My Account” section that enables users to store their information, access order history, and create wish lists, resulting in more meaningful customer touchpoints and encouraging brand loyalty across all of SRAM’s brands.
- Provide a way for their loyal fanbase to further immerse themselves in the SRAM lifestyle and connect with the brands directly.

## Blueprinting the B2B approach for B2C operations

SRAM wanted to leverage the “piping” already in place for their B2B portal on
Optimizely, which enables their thousands of OEM’s, distributors, and retailers
worldwide, to spin up a channel to reach their B2C customers. Optimizely was a
robust and flexible option to fill both their B2B and B2C needs with one
platform, and provide the rich content tools to bring the SRAM lifestyle to life
onsite.

Having already implemented a rich B2B portal for their global network of OEM’s,
Distributors, and Retailers, SRAM now sought to connect deeper with end-users of
their products and own the brand experience throughout. BlueBolt worked with
SRAM to come up with the right mix of Content and Commerce to enable this B2C
journey on the site, while also providing the facilities to locate local
distributors and retailers through their global dealer locator onsite. Through
these efforts their customers have the opportunity to purchase through their
channel partners or directly from SRAM. SRAM also now has the ability to own the
brand experience from the point of entry on the site to the post-purchase
customer service and follow-up experience.

Optimizely Commerce Cloud offers SRAM the ability to scale as their business
grows. Hosted on the Microsoft Azure Cloud, the website is sheltered from
downtime that may result in problematic customer experiences. This serverless
environment mean the SRAM team can focus on a truly customer-centric experience.

As part of this implementation, SRAM integrated to their PIM for product data,
along with their global SAP ERP system for inventory and order management.

## Planning for the long-run

SRAM has been working with Optimizely for several years building out their B2B
portal and catalogs, to serve their global network of OEM (bike manufacturers),
Distributors, and Retailers. Having worked with the platform for so long, the
team at SRAM knew the power and flexibility that Optimizely provides for both
B2B & B2C and it was a no-brainer to use it for their D2C launches.
