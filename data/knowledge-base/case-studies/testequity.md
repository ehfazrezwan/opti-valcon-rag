NASA and General Motors solve the toughest technical and financial challenges so
they can get their products off the ground.

experiences.

## Evolving with a changing marketplace

It’s no secret that the way we make purchases today is far different than it was
decades ago. TestEquity recognized changing market conditions like preferences
to self-serve and younger buyers entering the workforce and made a decision to
revamp their technology stack.

As an early adopter of eCommerce, TestEquity had a custom solution in place to
answer the changing needs of its customers. However, the solution was not
integrated to TestEquity’s ERP, was not responsive and was built on outdated
technology.

TestEquity underwent a wholistic business transformation that involved multiple
technologies working in harmony to deliver an enhanced customer experience.

simple extension of an ERP. It has B2B features built in and is customizable

## Finding the right eCommerce solution

TestEquity needed a powerful eCommerce platform that would enable the company to
quickly serve the needs of their customers and provide a better online
experience than their original platform.

TestEquity selected the Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud because it met many
requirements including:

- Customization capabilities
- Reliable and scalable infrastructure
- Ability to consolidate existing web platforms
- Mobile compatibility
- Real-time inventory
- PunchOut integrations
- PIM integration

## Driving business value with Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud

In May 2019, TestEquity launched the eCommerce site integrated with a
3<sup>rd</sup> party PIM, Payment Gateway, Live Chat and PunchOut to facilitate
seamless automation to their customer base.

Since launch, TestEquity has improved efficiencies, driven customer self-service
events and increased RFQ volume. The website enables TestEquity customers to
seamlessly research and purchase from a catalog of more than 10,000 products.

Less than 3 months after launching Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, TestEquity had
already doubled daily Requests for Quotes (RFQ), which they consider the
lifeblood of their business. Previously, TestEquity was seeing roughly 15 RFQs
per day, which increased to 27-30 per day after launch. TestEquity’s RFQs are
typically valued at around $8,000. They’re able to convert about 20%-30% of
their RFQs to sales. In addition to increasing RFQs, average order value has
more than doubled since launching their site one year ago.

The website is just part of TestEquity’s ongoing digital transformation strategy
in solidifying the company’s position as the industry-leading, single-source
provider of testing and electronic production supplies.
