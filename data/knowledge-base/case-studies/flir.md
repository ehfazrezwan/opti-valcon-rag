## Lighting The World With Innovative Product Design

FLIR Systems is the world leader in the design, manufacture, and marketing of
thermal imaging infrared cameras, surveillance security and numerous other high
worth electronic products. While the company’s 3,000+ products save lives and
protect livelihoods, the FLIR team struggled to bring their story to life.

The Oregon based manufacturing specialists were determined to build a B2B
commerce platform that would intelligently and effortlessly classify, sort, and
deliver the right product and experience based on a user’s needs and intent.

## Industry Leading

The new FLIR customer-centric experience now reflects that of an industry leader
and innovator. Core brand elements were redesigned to include updated messaging
that translates from packaging to product design and tradeshows to the website.
The updated space features all new visual elements including;

- Reimaged layout
- New and improved typography
- Visually appeasing photography style
- Informative product styling

All creative elements were conveniently built to allow for different types of
digital delivery and brand flexibility as product offerings continue to grow and
evolve.

The Optimizely Content Cloud, built on Microsoft Azure, hands FLIR operational
control when it comes to delivering a buying experience that exceeds the
expectations from its broad customer base.
