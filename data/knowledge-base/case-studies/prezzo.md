# Prezzo re-invents their digital engagement

## Something new on the menu

Following its offline rebrand, Prezzo turned its attention to their digital
strategy. With the competition in the casual dining market becoming more
saturated, and new entrants using disruptive technologies to gain traction,
Prezzo found that they too could differentiate themselves through their digital
experience.

The ambition was to use the digital channel to attract more casual diners, and
convert them into loyal customers, putting Prezzo back at the forefront of the
casual dining market. Optimizely’s partner Zone was brought in to help Prezzo
realise this ambition.

## The Strategy

Prezzo’s digital strategy was clear: they needed a new brand identity to match
their new offline brand. Their website, emails and other digital communications
needed to be brought together and optimised for mobile. In addition, they needed
to better understand their customer’s journey so they could deliver a truly
personalized experience. For this they needed to utilise the power of their
customer data and marketing automation.

To achieve their digital strategy, Prezzo needed a brand new website which
embraced the new Prezzo visual design and was enriched with features their old
site lacked.

The new features:

- Full content management capabilities
- Online booking facility
- Mobile optimised and responsive
- Single Customer View
- Integration with marketing automation platform
- Building a market-leading website was the first part of Prezzo’s digital strategy. They now needed to reengineer the way they interacted with their customer base through digital.

Prezzo really needed to understand their customers through analyzing the data
they held on them. This would help them segment their data to understand where
customers were in the journey (new diner, lapsed diner, loyal diner) so they
could send tailored email communications and show personalized web content. They
would then be able to create the right communications and flows that would help
them convert a new or lapsed diner into a loyal diner. And keep their loyal
customers happy.

So choosing a web content management system and marketing automation platform
that integrated with each other (Optimizely CMS and ExactTarget ERCM) was an
essential consideration for Prezzo’s digital strategy. And to ensure Prezzo’s
marketing team were more effective and efficient, it was important that they
could create and customise their ERCM email templates in-house, rather than
relying on an agency.

## The Build

The new, fully mobile responsive website was built using Optimizely Content
Cloud with a number of features integrated to enable a seamless diner experience
from research to booking:

To create a Single Customer View and support Prezzo’s ongoing CRM efforts, Zone
integrated Optimizely with Exact Target ECRM

With the use of mobile on the rise, a seamless location integration is vital to
user experience. Optimizely's Find service was utilized to support spontaneous
dining decisions made on mobile devices.

Driving bookings through social was always a key ambition, so the Twitter API
was used to generate social content.

For the crucial online reservation capabilities, the website was fully
integrated with the Bookatable system. It was critical this worked seamlessly
with Optimizely Find.

## The Outcome

Though the website was relaunched in the first quarter of 2015, Prezzo saw an
increase in the number of voucher codes redeemed, as well as the number of
takeaways and gift cards ordered through the website, suggesting we've found the
right balance of brand and function.
