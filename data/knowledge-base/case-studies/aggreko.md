# Aggreko brings a complicated sales process online

## Working around the clock to power the future

Around the world, people, businesses and countries are striving for a better
future. That future needs power and the right conditions to succeed. Aggreko
works around the clock to ensure people get the electricity, heating and cooling
they need, whenever they need it.

From urban development to unique commercial projects and even humanitarian
emergencies, Aggreko brings their expertise, equipment, passion and unrivaled
international experience to every project.

A supplier of temporary power generation equipment and temperature control
equipment, Aggreko leverages Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud to power their online
experience for renting generators.

## Mastering complex sales

Purchasing a temporary generator isn’t exactly a simple “add to cart and
purchase” transaction. But Aggreko has mastered the art of complex sales. They
were determined to create a simple and seamless renting experience.

When you rent a generator, there’s a lot of requirements to take into
consideration. Here are a few questions Aggreko has to ask each customer:

- How large do you need the generator to be?
- How far does the generator need to be from the connection point?
- What voltage is required?
- Do you need a generator with low emissions?
- How many hours will the generator be operating?
- What kind of environmental fees need to be considered?

Basically, it’s complicated to rent a generator. Bringing a complicated sales
process online would present some challenges. To make the complicated simple,
Aggreko needed an ecommerce partner that was able to support incredibly complex
buying scenarios right out of the box. They found that partner in Optimizely.
Now renting has been made easy.
