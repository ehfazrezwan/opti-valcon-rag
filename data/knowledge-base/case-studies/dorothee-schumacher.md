Founded in 1989 by Düsseldorf native Dorothee Schumacher, the brand began with a
T-shirt collection before expanding into knitwear. Following the opening of her
first showroom in Düsseldorf in 1994, the brand expanded to Paris and Milan.
Today, the label offers ready-to-wear fashion and accessories through eight
flagship stores and various pop-up locations across Europe and the USA, with
distribution in 49 countries.

In 2014, the brand was renamed from SCHUMACHER to DOROTHEE SCHUMACHER, and in
2017, her son Maximilian Singhoff joined as co-CEO. The company strengthened its
US presence with a dedicated showroom in 2020 and now employs 200 people from
over 16 nations.

## **The online store experience**

The online store serves as both a primary customer touchpoint for B2C and B2B
customers and a central branding platform. I**t is not only a digital sales
channel, but also serves as a central platform for the company's brand and
online image.** This dual role highlights the importance of seamlessly
integrating content and commerce to create a cohesive shopping experience that
goes beyond traditional e-commerce.

For Dorothee Schumacher, this integration between content and commerce
represents a key competitive advantage**, where user experience (UX), design,
and brand identity work together to create an immersive shopping journey.**

## **The challenge**

In today's omnichannel retail environment, businesses need a modern website that
combines cutting-edge technology with timeless, customizable design features.
However, Dorothee Schumacher's previous e-commerce platform, built on Shopware
5, was falling short in several critical areas:

1. **Security and Technical Constraints** : The outdated Shopware 5 platform was nearing end-of-support, creating security vulnerabilities and technical limitations.
2. **Administrative Complexity** : The platform's custom headless frontend architecture, combined with serving both B2B and B2C customers, made system updates extremely challenging.
3. **Rigid Infrastructure** : The platform's inflexible architecture made it difficult to integrate content management with e-commerce functionality.

After extensive evaluation of various solutions, Optimizely emerged as the clear
choice, offering an integrated and scalable platform. DEPT, an Optimizely
Enterprise Solution Partner, supported the relaunch project, building on their
14 year relationship with Dorothee Schumacher.
