## The Challenge

Vertiv, formerly Emerson Network Power, operate at the heart of facility
infrastructure bringing together hardware, software and analytics to enable
continuous running of vital applications for customers across the world.
Providing solutions across these vast regions bring their own complexities which
Vertiv have over 50 years of experience in handling.

Boasting a customer portfolio including the likes of Alibaba, AT&T, Siemens and
China Mobile, Vertiv required a digital environment capable of marketing
products in 18 different languages whilst simultaneously providing local
experience personalization.

The platform needed to be easily used by their internal teams to personalize
content and products on a regional basis, and succinctly integrate with their
current technology stack including BrandMaker, Okta and Translations.com.

Das Vertiv Team war Nervös, ein Rebranding und Relaunch des neu ausgegliederten
Unternehmens zu übernehmen. Aber Luminos Labs gab uns das Vertrauen in ihre
Fähigkeit und die Optimizely Digital Experience Platform, unsere Bedürfnisse als
Implementierungspartner zu erfüllen und zu übertreffen.

## The Solution

Vertiv and their Optimizely Premium Partner Luminos Labs opted for the
Optimizely Digital Experience Platform to deliver their digital aspirations.

Optimizely's DXP offers true flexibility for Vertiv to create a global hierarchy
of sites in different languages, personalize content across different regions
and drive engagement for their partner portal needs.

Optimizely's scalability enabled product owners to manage complex product
information across different regions. It allowed internal digital marketing
teams to create a personalization workflow to create truly localized
experiences.

Luminos Labs have been retained as an ongoing managed services partner to
support and maintain Vertiv’s growing instance of Optimizely, now serving
between 4 and 5 million visitors annually.
