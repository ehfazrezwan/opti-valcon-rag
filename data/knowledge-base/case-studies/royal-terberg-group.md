## Driving a digital estate for stronger collaboration with customers

Royal Terberg Group is a major multinational player in producing and developing
specialist transport vechicles. They operate 6 business units globally covering:

- Special Vehicles
- Environmental Equipment
- Modification Cars & Vans
- Modification Trucks
- Truck Mounted Forklifts
- Leasing

With their strong emphasis on invention, innovation, transformation and value
creation, Terbergâ€™s objective was to create an online digital platform that
interacted with its entire sales channel. It needed to communicate directly with
its international set of end customers. The platform also needed to be unique
for each sales process depending on the country.

## Speaking the language of its audience

Using the Optimizely Foundation opensource accelerator, Terberg was able to
quickly create CMS micro sites that were adaptable, versatile and technically
flexible in terms of the functionality available. The CMS needed to be able to
integrate with external tools without the fear of corruption within the
platform, this was one of the most important elements within the CMS for the
business.

Terberg is now running 20 sites using Optimizely across multiple languages
including English, German, Portuguese, French, Spanish and German to name a few.
These sites are segmented between divisions and countries making a typically
difficult process relatively straight-forward to manage. The result being a
platform that effectively manages content, integrates with external partners and
apps.

Terberg is currently in the process of changing all of its websites within the
organization over to Optimizely Foundation, which is testament to its confidence
in the digital solution and their implementation partner Arlanet who carry out
vast amounts of functionality and programming on the platform. The company have
the tools to execute against their vision - the functionality to filter various
items and then simultaneously display the content on various sites, making the
sites even more dynamic. For example, sharing messages with its customers about
news within the company, events that are taking place and even advertising job
postings within the business.
