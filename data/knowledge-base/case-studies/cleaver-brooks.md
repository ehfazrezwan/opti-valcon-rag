# Cleaver Brooks grew business over 20% in four years

The first OEM to conduct online sales - learn how Cleaver Brooks shook up their
industry

## Helping businesses run better every day

For nearly 90 years, Cleaver-Brooks has been keeping people warm. A manufacturer
and distributor of complete boiler room solutions, Cleaver-Brooks develops hot
water and steam generation products aimed at integrating and optimizing the
total boiler, burner, controls system to maximize energy efficiency and
reliability while minimizing emissions.

In an otherwise declining market, Cleaver-Brooks has grown their business over
20% in the last four years. Despite the fact that most companies have already
invested in boiler room solutions for their company, Cleaver-Brooks is still
able to continuously grow their market share based on their promises of quality,
reliability and world-class customer support.

Where there is success, there is opportunity. By listening to the market and
their customer base, Cleaver-Brooks knew they needed to get more tools in place
to take their business into the future. With ambitious aftermarket growth goals
and a dedication to going the extra mile for customers, Cleaver-Brooks voyaged
into eCommerce.

## Opening new channels and addressing new markets

Three years before investing in eCommerce, Cleaver-Brooks’ rep network was their
sole channel for part sales and estimates. While a reliable source, Cleaver-
Brooks recognized that they were only reaching about 25% of the total
addressable market and that eCommerce would open new channels and help them
reach more prospects. To grow their aftermarket business, beat the competition
and meet the needs of a changing buyer, Cleaver-Brooks needed a robust eCommerce
platform.

**Selecting Optimizely Configured Commerce**

Finding the right eCommerce platform isn’t always an easy task. To narrow their
search, Cleaver-Brooks created an RFP and analyzed 12 different eCommerce
providers. The providers were measured against a Pugh Matrix created by Cleaver-
Brooks’ IT, marketing and sales teams which helped them prioritize based on:

- Implementation Total Cost
- Maintenance/Ongoing Cost
- Implementation Team
- User Experience
- Sales Analytics Capabilities
- Functional Requirements
- 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Add-ons Needed
- Implementation Timeline
- CMS Capability
- Additional Sales Volume

After creating their matrix, they applied a weighting system to each category
based on pressing needs and “must-haves” within the application. Ultimately,
Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud outweighed other eCommerce platforms and met many
of Cleaver-Brooks’ requirements.

Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud was a clear winner from a business to business
standpoint. Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud met more eCommerce requirements than
the competition with features that came right out-of-the-box.

## The only OEM selling parts through eCommerce

Cleaver-Brooks is currently the only OEM selling parts through an eCommerce
platform. When you buy from Cleaver-Brooks, you know that you’re buying a
genuine OEM part that will fit your boiler. Customers are guaranteed the
quality, performance and reliability they are used to because they’re not buying
a third-party knock-off.

Cleaver-Brooks makes this possible by being findable. If somebody has a specific
part number or the name of a part, their eCommerce site can facilitate that sale
and get the customer’s needs addressed faster than ever before.

After launching their eCommerce site in October 2018, Cleaver-Brooks saw a
steady growth of adoption of the site, and an increase in returning customers to
the site. Customers can efficiently do their jobs with access to inventory,
custom pricing and easy online ordering.

With eCommerce launched, Cleaver-Brooks promises same day delivery to their
customers through 3 p.m.

## Leveraging the Optimizely platform

Cleaver-Brooks uses built-in B2B functionality within Optimizely to deliver
superior customer experiences.

Customers can use “Find a Representative” tools to identify the closest Cleaver-
Brooks representative partner.

Utilizing out-of-the-box product detail pages, Cleaver-Brooks gives customers
easy ways to quickly filter through product information and make purchases.

In an industry where most of their competitors are hiding it, Cleaver-Brooks is
able to provide transparent pricing and real-time availability for their
products.
