# University of Technology, Sydney sees 45% fall in drop off rate

Transforming a leading Australian University’s go-to-market learning offering

## High ranking

**The University of Technology, Sydney (UTS)** was recently ranked as the
Highest performing university in Australia under 50 years old, and amongst the
top 150 universities in the world (Source: Rankings and Ratings). **UTS Open**
is the first step in a broader initiative to create a high-quality marketplace
for postgraduate learning, by aggregating the diverse range of existing avenues
for learning that UTS offers.

With an overarching postgraduate on-ramp strategy, UTS needed to stand out in
the extremely competitive postgraduate online space. The task was to create a
compelling customer-centric website that clearly represents the UTS Open
positioning in the market and connects with the target audience by offering them
the content and experience they are looking for.

The foundation of the solution for UTS Open was built upon Optimizely, chosen
for it’s powerful experience-driven commerce and content management features.

The foundation of the solution for UTS Open was built upon the Optimizely
framework, which provides the powerful 1-2 punch of world class content
management features coupled with functionality that delivers on the promise of
experience-driven commerce, served up and supported via the Optimizely DXP cloud
platform.

The platform stack (mapped to the CAUDIT Higher Education Enterprise
Architecture Reference model)

- Curriculum Creation and Lifecycle: CIS
- Learner Recruitment Marketing: Optimizely CMS + Commerce + Insight + Advance, Salesforce Marketing Cloud
- Learner Identity Management: Azure B2C, Azure Directory, ADFS, Okta, Optimizely Commerce + Insight, Salesforce Education Cloud, Canvas LMS
- Learner Recruitment, Management & Retention: Optimizely CMS + Commerce + Insight, Salesforce Education Cloud, Service Now
- Content production & Scheduling: Optimizely CMS + Commerce, Canvas LMS

- Product Performance & Reporting: Oracle Financial system, SecurePay, Optimizely Commerce, Canvas LMS, Salesforce Education Cloud, Google Analytics + Data Studio
- Platform Integration: Dell Boomi, Optimizely CMS + Commerce, Canvas LMS, Salesforce Community Cloud

With a complex technology landscape of existing and new key systems, UTS Open
required a new approach to integration design for introducing commerce
capability into such an ecosystem.

Optimizely Commerce provided the solution to playing the role of the Source of
Truth/Master for

- Product creation
- Product authoring and definition
- Product pricing data….for some product types, whilst acting as a Replica for other product types, consuming product information from various systems and sources.

The authoring complexities across different product owners for different product
types, across multiple faculties, schools and business lines across the whole of
university, coupled with different levels of integration with multiple systems
to guarantee fulfillment of products, provide customer support and meet
compliance and reporting requirements, dictated a new conceptual approach was
necessary.

By extending and customising the model of products and variants we were able to
still retain flexibility, needed to meet future needs anticipated for the
platform, based on LXT rollout of the 2027 roadmap.

The solution delivered an ongoing, evolving customer-centric marketplace that
offers a streamlined user experience, catering for each stage of a learner’s
journey as a customer purchasing funnel.
