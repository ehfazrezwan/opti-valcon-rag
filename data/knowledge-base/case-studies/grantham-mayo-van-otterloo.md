# Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo sees a 45% email open rate

A rebrand in three parts

In early 2018, Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. LLC, a Boston-based asset
management ﬁrm, needed a platform solution and partner who could take a rebrand
from design to implementation without missing a beat.

The main challenge was to identify and implement the correct technology
solutions to drive GMO’s business objectives of prioritizing thought leadership,
building brand awareness, and increasing operational eﬃciency.

## Under Control

Verndale were selected as GMO's development partner in May 2018. Multiple
Verndale teams worked in concert to validate the creative deliverables produced
by GMO’s design ﬁrm, identify any gaps in the artifacts needed for a successful
Optimizely implementation, and conﬁrm the development plan for a phased release
of a new GMO.co.

Beginning with Growth Strategy & Experience Design and an intensive, one-day
Measurement Planning Workshop, Verndale’s Technology Enablement team built the
technical foundation for GMO.com’s successful future.

Custom technology enablement coupled with Optimizely functionality equalled a
highly engaged customer base. Since launch, over 150,000 emails have been sent
to targeted GMO clients. Of those 150,000 emails, nearly 45% have been opened
with a CTR of nearly 14%. Users on the site engage at a higher rate, visiting
nearly four pages per session and converting nearly 36% of the time.
