## Disrupting 150 years of banking

Launched in 2010 in the UK, Metro Bank is the first new high street bank in more
than 150 years. The revolutionary “challenger” bank offers personal, commercial,
business and private banking services, with a focus on providing unparalleled
levels of customer service and convenience.

## Consumer banking demands more

When it comes to personal banking, consumers want easy online transactions
across their devices. Metro Bank understood the importance of each customer
interaction – including creating new accounts and day-to-day withdrawals. The
bank took action by revamping their digital estate to better meet the needs of
their more than one million customers.

## Previous website difficult to use and edit

With rapid growth in customers and branches, Metro Bank needed to ensure its
digital experiences could keep up. However, the bank faced several platform
challenges:

- Their platform did not accurately reflect their service offering, brand identity or vision to new and existing customers.
- The website was incompatible with mobile devices, posing a significant inconvenience.
- Internal content editors couldn’t update the site quickly and easily.

## Banking on Optimizely

Optimizely’s solution was chosen as the ideal platform to create Metro Bank’s
new digital environment.

As well as being able to transform the public-facing website to reflect the
bank’s award-winning service offering, implementing Optimizely meant the site
was fully responsive on all mobile devices. Metro Bank could take advantage of
Optimizely’s advanced capabilities, such as personalization, while future-
proofing digital assets with Optimizely’s continuous roadmap development.

## Delivering complex, integrated sites

Building the revamped site, Optimizely Premium Partner Netcel used their
renowned expertise to deliver the complex, large-scale, multi-faceted project in
just five months.

Metro Bank now boasts a device-agnostic site, fully responsive across all
devices. Internal stakeholders are delighted with the enhanced editing elements
with these improvements. The team benefits from stronger content management
capabilities, resulting in more time to create valuable experiences for
customers. Detecting user location to deliver personalized content allows Metro
Bank to engage meaningfully with online visitors. All while following strict
security and compliance standards.

Since the launch, Netcel has been working on subsequent releases that
incorporate new requirements, as well as optimizing existing features such as a
mortgage calculator tool.
