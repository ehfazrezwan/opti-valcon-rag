# Optos offers a B2B commerce platform fit-for-purpose

World-leading provider of medical devices for eye care professionals saw the
light with Optimizely's customer-centric Digital Experience Platform

## ''We needed a digital infrastructure overhaul''

Since 1992 renowned optical medical device practitioners, Optos have been the
leading provider of devices to eye care professionals for improved patient care.
They utilize the latest technology to manufacture new products and software that
improve the standard of care, helping eye care professionals around the world
save sight and save lives.

With their customer base growing rapidly, and the needs of their customers
changing, Optos wanted to completely upgrade their Customer Portal and needed to
offer a B2B commerce platform that was fit-for-purpose. Optos had been an
Optimizely house for several years but had not upgraded their digital
infrastructure, their acquisition by Nikon provided them with the impetus to
move business operations to a truly digital offering.
