# Dillon Supply goes beyond products and transactions

## Helping customers operate better today

A wholesale distributor of industrial safety, storage and handling and metal
equipment, Dillon Supply has more than 20 locations and serves a diverse
customer base ranging from manufacturing, construction, administration and other
markets.

Everything Dillon Supply does is built on the belief that their relationship
with their customers should be more than products or transactions. Above all,
Dillon Supply aims to enable their customers to operate better today than they
did yesterday. That’s why their mission is to walk alongside their customers,
understand their businesses and deliver relevant products and solutions.

When their customers began asking for better means to interact with their
business, they didn’t hesitate to transform and innovate.

## Delivering a better customer experience with Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud

Prior to leveraging Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, Dillon Supply had been on an
eCommerce platform for about 12 years. However, they did not heavily invest in
the platform, nor was it meeting their needs. They wanted a new solution that
could help them better serve their customers in the future.

When they set out to find a new platform, Dillon Supply narrowed their search
down to three different platforms. They completed deep analysis of the platforms
and ultimately chose to partner with Optimizely.

Since implementing B2B Commerce Cloud, the feedback from Dillon Supply’s
internal sales team and with customers has been very positive. Users enjoy the
intuitive navigation and report a positive customer experience.
