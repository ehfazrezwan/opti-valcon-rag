## Consolidated Supply does ordinary things extraordinarily well

At Consolidated Supply Co. service goes far beyond the ordinary. From the moment
the company opened its doors over 90 years ago, Consolidated Supply has been
committed to delivering extraordinary customer service and the highest quality
plumbing, heating and water works solutions to professional plumbers and utility
contractors.

In an effort to continue delivering extraordinary service in an ever-evolving
industry, Consolidated Supply transformed their business with Optimizely B2B
Commerce Cloud.

## Serving customers in the 21<sup>st</sup> century (and competing with national

players)

Consolidated Supply Co. is a company ahead of their time. As other players in
the industry struggle to keep up with the pace, Consolidated Supply is setting
the gold standard for seamless digital experiences in B2B. The company knew they
had to deploy a digital branch or risk losing customers to national competitors.

## Selecting a robust B2B eCommerce solution

Josh Schoonmaker, Consolidated Supply’s Director of Digital Solutions was hired
in August 2017 to manage eCommerce. In his first two weeks in his role, he was
tasked with analyzing the best solution for the company. Schoonmaker created a
decision matrix with 30 different criteria to measure potential eCommerce
providers against. He also valued analyst reports by leading research firms like
Forrester and Gartner. Ultimately he chose the Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud
solution for a few key reasons:

- Customer success model rather than support agent
- Admin Console built with the business user in mind
- Rich B2B features built-in
- Fully functional mobile app
- Fully managed SaaS based solution
- Customizable to meet the design needs of Consolidated
- Easily integrated with Consolidated’s Eclipse ERP
- Robust content management system
- Custom pricing and catalog capabilities
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Focus on complexities of B2B

## A complete paradigm shift

At Consolidated Supply, it was never just about an eCommerce website. It was
about changing the way the company did business for the better. Consolidated
Supply has always done whatever it takes to best serve the customer, even if
that means making significant changes.

The Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud was able to meet 85% of Consolidated Supply’s
core B2B requirements right out-of-the-box. After launching the website,
Consolidated saw an increase in registration, self-service activities and
productivity of their team members. Customers now have 24/7 access to pricing
and availability of Consolidated’s products.

## Product content as ecommerce fuel

Consolidated Supply leverages the AD eContent Service to provide the product
content fuel to the B2B Commerce Cloud engine. This enables Consolidated’s
customers to find what they need to find and build confidence in Consolidated’s
products. The AD and Optimizely partnership enables Consolidated to increase
customer self-service, take care of their own needs and power their sales team
to focus on completing high value tasks through ecommerce.

## Increase in efficiencies and adoption

Since implementing Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, Consolidated Supply has seen
an increase in customer satisfaction, online ordering and team efficiencies.
Less than one year after implementing InsiteCommerce, the amount of online
registered users doubled. Moreover, 18 months from launch, online registered
users increased by 157%.

Consolidated recognized that eCommerce wasn’t just a project. It wasn’t
something they would deploy then move away from. After the initial launch,
Consolidated was receiving feedback from customers about certain struggles and
questions with the website.

Three months after launch, the company set out to hire two Digital Engagement
Specialists (DES) solely dedicated to building a better eCommerce website.

The DES interact directly with customers, utilizing feedback from employees and
customers to improve the website and create a user-friendly experience that
promotes efficiency and growth with Consolidated’s customers. The DES are
focused on managing and assisting users with Consolidated’s website and mobile
app and are yet another example of Consolidated’s continued focus on delivering
extraordinary service.

The team implemented weekly “Engagement Metrics” tracking that produces an
Engagement Rank for every customer. Ranks include: Super, High, Standard, Low
and Not Yet Digital. Since hiring the DES, Consolidated has seen more than 10
times growth of super users. In addition, Active Ordering customers (those that
have ordered multiple times in the last 90 days) has increased by 146% since the
DES began.

Consolidated Supply is delivering on the promise of extraordinary service with a
fully functional eCommerce solution, and a dedicated team focused on continuous
improvement of the site. It’s a technology-meets-human solution. And it’s
setting up Consolidated Supply to serve their customers for the next 90 years.
