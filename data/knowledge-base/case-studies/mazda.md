# Mazda transformed their website from an online brochure to a responsive, data-

driven platform.

## Adapting to new behavior for car purchases

Increasingly, customers are buying and researching cars online. Mazda recently
decided that its website for the North American market was not sufficiently
helping customers research and select the right car.

"The customer experience has grown in importance," says Ben Rounsefell, Sr.
Manager, Digital, Customer Engagement at Mazda. "The level of detail required to
configure and find a product is an expectation on any modern vehicle website.
Before our digital transformation, the site we had was very hard to maintain. We
missed a lot of opportunities to grow with industry trends."

## A user-friendly platform for global and local experiences

To solve this problem, Mazda contacted its creative partner, The Garage Team
Mazda, and global digital agency Mirum to begin developing a new site. At the
center of the new site was the Optimizely platform.

"We knew that Optimizely was a pretty strong product from experience overseas,"
says Rounsefell. "Anything we do from a local point of view should be shareable
globally. Optimizely allows that flexibility."

## New tools for a better customer journey

With the new site, Mazda shoppers can now easily research and select a vehicle
with fewer clicks, and for the first time from mobile devices. The content is
relevant and up to date, including reference materials for current owners.

"Our results were impressive," Rounsefell says. "We have much higher engagement,
smooth navigation, and new features around locating a dealer from a proximity
point of view that we hadn't had before."

In the first two months after the site was launched, it had almost five million
unique visitors and a 200 percent improvement in engagement.

"We went from an online brochure to a mobile-driven, data-driven immersive
platform," Rounsefell says. "If I was being asked to recommend Optimizely, I
wouldn't have a hesitation. The technology backing the project was flawless."
