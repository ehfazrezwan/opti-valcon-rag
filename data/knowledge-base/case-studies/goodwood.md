## Transcript

_An example page highlighting Goodwood's new modern digital experience_**Why
Optimizely?** Simon Gardiner, Head of Digital Product at Goodwood Estate,
explained that Goodwood began to utilize Optimizely’s CMS in 2016 due to the
limitations of their legacy CMS, which was not mobile-optimized and became
cumbersome to manage. Optimizely’s CMS offered the scalability, flexibility, and
user-friendly interface required to manage Goodwood's vast content and high
traffic volumes, enabling a seamless and engaging digital experience.

The initial move to Optimizely CMS in 2016 marked a significant improvement, but
the sprawling nature of the website still posed challenges. Upgrading to CMS 12
provided Goodwood with the tools needed to streamline their content management
processes and improve overall site performance.

**Why CMS 12?** Goodwood’s transition to Optimizely’s CMS 12, the fastest
version to date, was driven by the need for improved performance and
scalability. CMS 12 offers enhanced user experience and access to new
functionalities, essential for Goodwood’s ambitious digital goals. The decision
to upgrade was a strategic move to leverage the latest advancements in CMS
technology and provide a superior digital experience for their visitors.

CMS 12 improves website performance and reduces load times, crucial for events
like the Festival of Speed. Its scalability ensures stability during peak
traffic, while new features simplify site management, enhancing the user
experience for both administrators and visitors.**Goodwood’s comprehensive
website redesign** The redesign of Goodwood's website was a comprehensive effort
to create a modern digital experience that encapsulates the essence of
Goodwood's premium brand. The new website features a clean, sleek design with a
heavy emphasis on high-quality video content, offering an immersive experience
that reflects the prestige and elegance of Goodwood.

Brand identity is paramount to Goodwood, and our website must do our brand
justice. Moving components from Storybook design to the Optimizely CMS
efficiently and accurately is a crucial way of achieving this. Optimizely is a
great platform for a design-centric business.

Head of Digital Product, Goodwood

**Design and\*\***Development Process\*\* The redesign process was meticulous and
involved extensive collaboration among Goodwood’s digital team and their trusted
partner, dotcraft. The process included several key stages:

1. Interactive whiteboarding sessions using Fig Jam allowed stakeholders to contribute their objectives, competitor analysis, and key performance indicators (KPIs). This collaborative approach ensured that the new website met the diverse needs of Goodwood’s different business units, from motorsport events to hospitality services.
2. All designs were created in Figma, providing a detailed visual representation of the new website. The team utilized Figma’s interactive capabilities to gather feedback and make iterative improvements. This stage was crucial for ensuring the website's design aligned with Goodwood's brand values and visual identity.
3. Transitioning from Figma to Storybook, the development team built and tested the components before integrating them into Optimizely CMS 12. This method ensured that the final product was both visually appealing and functionally robust. The team focused on creating reusable components to streamline development and ensure consistency across the site.
4. Migrating content from the old CMS to the new platform was a significant task. The team developed a strategy to ensure a smooth transition, including cleaning up outdated content and optimizing new content for performance and SEO.

## **Enhanced Content Process and Use Cases**

Goodwood's upgrade to CMS 12 and the comprehensive website redesign have
significantly enhanced Goodwood’s digital presence. Advanced features like
Visitor Groups and the Visual Editor have empowered Goodwood to deliver a
dynamic, personalized, and visually captivating experience for their audience.
The new website not only reflects the luxury and premium nature of the Goodwood
brand but also provides an efficient and engaging user experience.

Storytelling is key for us, and structured data significantly enhances it. We've
created brand snippets—little bits of trivia tagged and built as blocks—so
visitors see different facts each time they visit a page. This approach keeps
the site fresh and engaging. Additionally, incorporating crisp, clean movements
and ensuring fast load times are crucial for maintaining the luxury feel of our
site. Optimizely's DXP and Azure stack's high performance ensure everything runs
smoothly.

Head of Digital Product

By leveraging Optimizely's Visitor Groups, Goodwood can tailor content
dynamically based on user behaviour and characteristics. This allows them to
define segments such as first-time visitors, returning members, or users engaged
in specific content categories, ensuring that each visitor receives the most
relevant information. This segmentation enhances engagement by showing content
that aligns with the visitor’s interests and past interactions, providing
flexibility and control to quickly adapt to changing user behaviours and
preferences.The Visual Editor in Optimizely's CMS has been instrumental in
Goodwood's ability to create and preview content seamlessly. Key benefits
include real-time previews that allow quick switches to visual preview mode to
see how content blocks stack up, ensuring that the layout and design are
visually appealing and functional across devices. Mobile optimization features
enable easy checks on how content renders on different devices, ensuring a
consistent and high-quality user experience on mobile platforms.Efficient
editing and instant publishing allow for quick iterations and immediate updates,
crucial during events or promotional periods. Additionally, the ability to
visualize how different visitor groups will see the content makes it easier to
ensure that personalization strategies are effectively implemented.

The benefit of the Visual Editor is key. It allows us to quickly switch into
visual preview mode to see how blocks work together, view the mobile rendering,
and check how different visitor groups see content. This capability is
invaluable and can be done within a few clicks, providing a practical view of
dynamic changes that Storybook alone can't offer.

Simon Gardiner

Head of Digital Product

Goodwood’s focus on storytelling is significantly enhanced by the CMS’s ability
to manage structured data. This capability allows them to utilize dynamic,
interchangeable content blocks, such as trivia facts and quotes, that keep the
site feeling fresh and engaging for repeat visitors. Tagging and associating
content with relevant metadata ensures that the most appropriate and interesting
snippets are displayed, enriching the visitor's experience with every visit.

User management within Optimizely’s CMS allows Goodwood to control who can edit,
publish, and change content, providing a structured workflow that is essential
for maintaining the integrity of their site. This capability is particularly
useful during high-pressure periods, such as when new events go on sale, as it
facilitates the preparation, review, and approval of multiple updates
simultaneously.Security is another critical aspect where Optimizely excels,
allowing Goodwood to focus on their core mission without undue concern. The
CMS’s robust .NET foundation and integration with Azure provide a secure and
scalable environment, which has passed extensive penetration testing. This
robust security setup means that Goodwood's team can dedicate more time to
enhancing their brand rather than worrying about potential vulnerabilities.With
CMS 12, Goodwood can now easily manage and update content, ensuring a consistent
and engaging user experience. The improved speed and scalability of CMS 12 have
allowed Goodwood to handle high traffic volumes seamlessly, which is crucial
during major events like the Festival of Speed and Goodwood Revival. The new
website has achieved impressive performance metrics, including a 93 out of 100
on core web vitals. The faster load times and improved responsiveness contribute
to higher user satisfaction and engagement.

**Partnership with Optimizely anddotcraft**

dotcraft has been a critical partner, providing the technical expertise and
support needed to manage Goodwood’s DXP instance on the Azure platform. Their
collaboration with Optimizely’s tech teams ensures that the platform runs
smoothly, allowing Goodwood to focus on delivering an exceptional digital
experience. They handle the heavy lifting and technical management, ensuring the
site’s stability and performance.

Our agency partner, Dotcraft, has been with us since the beginning. Dotcraft is

**Useful Integrations** Optimizely’s CMS 12 has enabled Goodwood to integrate
various third-party tools and platforms seamlessly, enhancing their digital
capabilities.

Vimeo, Brightcove, and YouTube integrations enable high-quality video content
delivery, allowing easy embedding and management within the CMS, resulting in
vibrant auto-play motion graphics and high-definition videos.

The Bynder integration streamlines asset management, facilitating efficient
handling and deployment of extensive imagery and video content. Editors can
quickly find, manage, and deploy assets without leaving the CMS. Additionally,
integrations with Google Tag Manager and custom web services for CRM integration
enable detailed tracking and analysis of user behaviour, crucial for refining
digital strategies and understanding user preferences.**Conclusion** Goodwood’s
