## Background

The New Brunswick Liquor Corporation, operating as Alcool NB Liquor (ANBL) hold
responsibility for the purchase, importation, distribution, and retail activity
for all beverage alcohol in the New Brunswick Province, Canada. Following the
legalization of Cannabis, ANBL received the mandate to be sole seller in the
province, including online and instore purchases under its subsidiary Cannabis
NB.

With access to a newly formed marketplace, ANBL wanted to capture and understand
their consumers profiles. This way, they could smartly recommend not only the
right product and tools but give curated advice on the complete experience
whilst complying with legislation.

The challenges of this mandate included an accelerated timeline and the need for
strict compliance with regulations for the commercialization of cannabis.
Cannabis NB was also required to provide detailed educational information about
cannabis products and their effects, as part of a strong social responsibility
mission.

ANBL was facing strong pressure to launch and support a complete new line of
business in less than 6 months. The challenging timeline to meet imposed federal
government legal deadline combined with advanced retail omni-channel
requirements made it critical for us to choose the right platform and partner to
achieve such an endeavour. The Optimizely platform combined with the Microsoft
Dynamics 365 for Retail capabilities enabled us not just to meet our deadlines
but also to face extreme peaks during launch.

## Solution

It was this need for a content-rich platform, in addition to a robust commerce
experience, that made Optimizely Digital Experience Platform and Microsoft
Dynamics 365 the right choice. ANBL selected Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance
& Operations, natively integrated with Optimizely Digital Experience Platform,
for its cannabis retail solution under the subsidiary Cannabis NB.

Besides the quick time-to-market, the cloud-based platform answered scalability
requirements. The Digital Experience Platform infrastructure allowed ANBL to
experience peaks during heavy online transactions. Its capabilities provide a
seamless, user friendly operation that enables a nimble client team to operate
and manage the platform.

ANBL took advantage of the platforms ability to facilitate multiple integrations
to third party systems (Payment solutions, 3-PLs, suppliers for product
information) equipping the retailer with the digital ecosystem needed to exceed
customer needs. The Optimizely native integration with Dynamics 365 for Retail
and Modern POS in the Microsoft Azure Cloud were fundamental to succeed.

The unified operation and experience approach across omnichannel was critical in
providing a seamless experience for customers. ANBL were also able to manage and
adhere to legislation restrictions and respect regulations easily and quickly.

## Outcomes

The solution was built in less than 6 months, and now fully supports the
province’s cannabis online and retail sales operations, including:

- product and catalog management
- payment and checkout
- comprehensive educational content
- operations management for 20 physical stores

A key part of Cannabis NB’s mandate was to understand consumer intentions and
objectives when using cannabis, so it could recommend the right products and
tools for the customer. Optimizely uses advanced AI to personalize content for
every single visitor, a feature that could be leveraged in the future to meet
this objective.

By fully complying with legislation, ANBL is helping guide consumers on the type
and amount of product, point out potential side effects, and act as ambassadors
for responsible cannabis use.

The platform is scalable for future needs. After launch, additional omnichannel
scenarios (buy online for in-store pick up; ship to home from store; and
distributed order management) are being developed to enhance customer
experience.
