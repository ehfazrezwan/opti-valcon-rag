# Stratco Australia's new platform has a 50% faster page load time

Transforming Stratco’s Ecommerce Platform

Both the Australia and New Zealand platforms are built on Optimizely CMS and
hosted in the Digital Experience Platform. The platforms make extensive use of
Optimizely Find, Optimizely Commerce, and Optimizely's personalization engine.

## Search in focus

The new websites are designed to quickly get customers to what they are looking
for. A rich digital experience also provides enjoyable research pathways via
‘How To’ advice and useful product recommendations. Intuitive navigation and
tailored content delivers individualised experiences for customers.

Given the majority of customers start their shopping activity with search,
Fusion worked hard to setup and tune the in-site search to match customer search
behaviors.

From the outset, Stratco and Fusion have been one team working in partnership on
a big goal. We’ve collaborated on a strong, clear and compelling digital
proposition that is already providing an uplift in sales.

## Large range of products

To present Stratco’s range of over 14,000+ products, Fusion completed an
advanced integration of Optimizely’s Commerce suite with Stratco's ERP. This
provides customers with up-to-date product information, location-based pricing
and inventory levels.

Customers can checkout as a guest, Click and Collect their products and redeem
vouchers during the purchase flow. Quotes for larger products such as patios or
garages can be requested using the quote request tool.

The new platform has a 50% faster page load time than the legacy Stratco website
on most pages. Fusion also gave careful consideration to the CMS setup so that
Stratco's content editors can easily manage, personalise and publish content
without requiring development.

## Next steps

Fusion is now working with the Stratco team to continue improving the new
platform for their customers and business.
