## Delivering research that gets the attention of Wall Street and global

economists

First reported in 1931 at the request of the US President and consistently
delivered (except during WWII), ISM developed the methodology and has delivered
what is known today as the ISM® Report On Business®. It is made up of
Manufacturing (PMI®), Services (PMI™) and newly introduced Hospital (PMI™) and
entails a national survey of purchasing managements, measuring supply chain
related changes in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. The all-
important report is widely considered as one of the most reliable barometers of
the US economy, helping provide relevant information for the national
government, Wall Street and economists worldwide.

Beyond the research, ISM at their core, takes a strong stance on corporate
social responsibility, ethics and sustainability. That's why they are not only
heavily involved in gathering data and trends, but also in the continuing
education for all those pursuing and currently in the supply chain profession.

## Changing digital presence

With a 100-year history, change is something ISM embraces. It’s something that
has helped keep them relevant all this time. When it comes to digital, it’s a
large part of what they do today to connect with their global community. ISM
works hard to implement the voice-of-customer into their digital operations and
their approach to infrastructure to enable them digitally. Unleashing Optimizely
Content Cloud has allowed the team to serve members in a more sustainable
fashion, reducing the amount of print needed for published materials. Their
digital experience platform has improved the reach of their content - it's
simply easier to facilitate to more people in a meaningful and personalized way.

## The making of ISM 2.0

ISM’s prior website truly didn’t represent the thought leadership and pioneering
spirit of the organization. They needed a platform that would emulate their
mission digitally. They deployed Content Cloud to serve as a member-first
community platform that provided great content and research, including
incorporating their magazine, _Inside Supply Management_.

The ISM digital platform utilizes Marketing Automation to convey a more
personalized experience and showcase the ISM brand in a more relevant way. Users
are given the opportunity to access what educational courses they've purchased
and easily see what their membership status is.

ISM leverages the power to, at any time, learn how the website is performing
against expectation. They can see whether produced content was successfully
consumed, or whether a user was not as engaged as desired. This helps inform
their content strategy by dictating what needs to be done in the future to drive
engagement and overall membership satisfaction.

## Why ISM are delighted with their digital platform:

- Technology peace-of-mind
- Modernized technology infrastructure
- The ability to handle important, sensitive content
- Mobile friendly
- Ease-of-use
- Decentralized management of content
- The ability to support future digital growth
- Personalization capabilities
- Reliable technology partner

## Long term buy-in

The right partner is important to enable ISM on their digital journey. That's
why they made the investment in Optimizely for the long-term strategy. The next
step will be further development of their Commerce Cloud environment to deliver
even greater digital experiences for members. Personalization and customizing
the front-end of the site will continue to increase member engagement, helping
to cement ISM's mission.

In terms of the future, ISM is also excited by the opportunity to surprise and
delight members without 'heavy lifting'. Optimizely's Digital Experience
Platform delivers Content, Commerce and Personalization on one screen,
simplifying ISM's technology stack. Therefore, this is the single, unified tool
that will help ISM further connect with professional communities within the
supply chain.
