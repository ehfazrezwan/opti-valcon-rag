# How Pepper Group personalized and tested with our DXP

Pepper Group Limited (Pepper) approached the market to identify an Enterprise
digital experience management solution to replace their existing CMS and web
platform.

## The Challenge

The business had a team of seven in-house developers supporting the three-year
old system through iterative cycles of enhancements and maintenance efforts. One
of the main objectives for the new platform, was to simplify the enhancement
process. The solution also had to provide equivalent functionality, while
streamlining the authoring process for content editors.

The new solution required existing compatibility and pre-built integration with
Salesforce CRM and Salesforce Marketing Cloud marketing automation, along with
the ability to deliver an authenticated broker portal to supply access to
specific content and tools.

It has been remarkable that we have essentially built three years of capability
in three months.

## The Solution

Pepper evaluated a number of vendors and selected Optimizely's Digital
Experience Platform service for CMS and marketing due to the platform's full
compliance with Pepper's requirements, approach to integration with the broader
digital ecosystem, and some other differentiating features.

As Pepper's previous CMS was hosted and managed by a partner agency, they
initially considered a third-party hosting provider; however, concerns around
de-centralized responsibility and additional effort to manage all parties
involved led them to instead consider the Digital Experience Cloud - a PaaS
offering that is full managed and hosted by Optimizely.

The customer felt that the PaaS offering would reduce the number of partners
involved in the project and guaranteed them stable and robust performance. The
scalable infrastructure was something that they felt differentiated Optimizely,
as well as the diminished requirement for infrastructure across their global
operations in UK, Ireland and Australia.

The benefits they identified included:

- A single vendor for both application and hosting
- Elastic scaling of resources when visitor numbers fluctuate
- A Dev/Ops capability that could be leveraged for their development
- The Azure web-apps architecturefor improvements in security and vulnerability management
- Guaranteed SLA for uptime and performance

## The Result

As a challenger brand in many of their markets, Pepper sees Digital and Customer
Experience as a key differentiator for its brokers and customers. Pepper
selected Optimizely for many of the leading capabilities that they believe will
support their ambitions with acquistion, improve customer and broker service and
allow them to engage with their stakeholders. In particular, leading capabilties
included:

- Optimizely Personalization, to deliver relevant and contextual content and information
- Optimized content for mobile experiences
- Optimizely Find, to improve the on-page search experience and surfacing of relevant content
- Optimizely AB Test, to optimize digital marketing conversion
- Simplified authoring for campaigns and landing pages
