well as business travel parts of the site. This included adaptations for
increased sales with add-ons etc including design, functionality, speed amongst
a list of new digital requirements. New capabilities such as fast updates of

Elite Hotels marketing and facilitate end user demand.

changes without interfering with constant booking of rooms. Moreover a solution
that gives administrators a tool that is easy to work with. After evaluating
several other platforms, Optimizely Content Cloud was chosen for its high
