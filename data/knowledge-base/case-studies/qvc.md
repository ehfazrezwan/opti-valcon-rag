Better performance values thanks to two-stage reactivation campaign

## The challenge

At QVC, customers can choose between different newsletter formats, including the
daily offer mail sent out every day. However, the proportion of recipients who
do not interact with the mailings or send them unread to the wastepaper basket
was growing steadily. To turn these inactive recipients back into active
openers, QVC brought Optimizely's Business Consulting on board. The
collaboration was an obvious choice, as the company had already been using
Optimizely Campaign for its email marketing for a long time.

With Optimizely Campaign, we were not only able to win back our inactive
recipients, we can now also write to them automatically at the right time. This
allows us to create increased and qualitative customer loyalty in the long term.
We also benefit from the reduced time required thanks to automated campaign
management and extensive monitoring and analysis functions.

## The solution

QVC planned a two-stage reactivation campaign with Optimizely in the period from
January to June 2020. The aim of the campaign was to encourage inactive
recipients to open QVC mailings again and interact with the content - without
incentives such as vouchers or competitions.

At the start of the campaign on January 28, 2020, all recipients who had not
opened any mailings from QVC in the last 90 days were initially recorded. They
did not receive any further newsletters for the next 14 days so that the
recipients' inboxes remained free of QVC newsletters for this period to allow
more exposure for the kick-off mailing. Only then did the reactivation start
with a kick-off mailing with the subject line ‚ÄúDo you want to open this mail...?
üò≤‚Äù. The email itself contained an image personalization with the recipient's
first name as well as missed offers, specials, sales and other benefits from
which the user could benefit even without incentives. The highlight: a central
‚Äúcall-to-action‚Äù button led the recipient to the QVC Preference Center. There
they have the opportunity to adjust their profile data and select their
preferred newsletter formats.

In the next step, a follow-up mailing was sent seven days later with identical
content but the subject line ‚ÄúDo you know what we think about you?‚Äù to those
recipients who had not opened the initial mailing. The adapted subject line was
intended to encourage recipients to open the mailing.

At the end of the campaign, all reactivated recipients, i.e. those who
interacted with one of the mailings by opening or clicking on it, were
transferred back to regular communication. They now receive the usual QVC
newsletters again. Recipients who are still inactive are automatically excluded
from regular mailings.

The results of the campaign kick-off are impressive. 25.22 percent of the
previously inactive recipients were motivated to engage with the QVC mailings
again in this way. QVC also recorded an impressive click-to-open rate of 25.76
percent and an unsubscribe rate of less than one percent.
