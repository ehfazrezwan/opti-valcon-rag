# SPI Health and Safety optimizes with B2B Commerce Cloud

## Prioritizing the health and safety of thousands of workers

Headquartered in Québec, Canada, SPI Health and Safety (SPI) is an occupational
health and safety products distributor on a mission to be the single most
valuable partner for companies that value health and safety in their work
environment.

With over 20 locations across Canada, SPI offers environmental, eye and face,
fall, fire, footwear, hand, head, hearing, and respiratory protection products,
as well as training and technical and consulting services.

With evolving customer expectations, heightened competition and generational
changes top of mind, SPI set out to deliver better customer experiences for
their B2B and B2C customers with a omnichannel strategy.

## From a precarious platform to a superior experience

SPI’s original ecommerce platform served them well in the beginning, but had
many limitations. The platform did not allow the team to manage different
warehouses or display sizes through a drop down menu. Growth into new markets
was stagnant, navigation was complicated and search was not intuitive. Because
of the ongoing feedback obtain from their customers (Voice of customer program)
SPI determined these capabilities were table stakes going forward.

SPI’s number one priority in investing in ecommerce was to build an omnichannel
strategy that would meet customers’ expectations online and offline. They wanted
to be empowered to sell their complete 360 health and safety offer across any
channel.

## The right fit helps SPI reach new heights

SPI worked with Absolunet, a leading ecommerce agency, to determine their
technology requirements going forward. SPI selected Optimizely B2B Commerce
Cloud as the platform that would power their intuitive, modern ecommerce
experience. In addition, they selected inRiver (which seamlessly integrated with
B2B Commerce Cloud) to manage their product content. In less than a year,
Absolunet successfully helped SPI Health and Safety migrate to B2B Commerce
Cloud and implement inRiver PIM.

SPI’s new website features:

- Quick order
- Order approval
- Multiple Bill-To options
- Functional search bar for products and contents
- Filters in product listing pages
- Simplified navigation
- Seamless checkout process
- Responsive website
- Blog articles
- Online training sessions

Our ecommerce site has helped build customer loyalty. After implementing
ecommerce and monitoring our digital evolution, we’ve seen our digital net
promoter score increase by 32 points.

## Meeting customers’ expectations and looking ahead

After implementing B2B Commerce Cloud, SPI’s customers are extremely satisfied.
Online transactions are easier and NPS Score has jumped. As SPI has monitored
their digital evolution, they’ve secured a 32 point increase in their digital
net promoter score.

SPI recognized this was not just about implementing technology and moving on.
They worked diligently to onboard their sales teams and customers to their new
website with videos, trainings and sales workshops. They knew that gaining buy-
in for ecommerce was essential for the success of the digital transformation.
SPI also needed to be able to provide the right solution to address the
requirements of their major customers that were asking for Punchout access.

SPI predicts their website will help them better serve their customers and
increase market share in the future. Other priorities include building out rich
product information, improving the speed of the website and delivering a better
overall experience that is personalized for each user.
