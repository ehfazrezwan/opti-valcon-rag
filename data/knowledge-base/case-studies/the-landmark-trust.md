# The Landmark Trust uses digital to serve a charitable cause

A digital strategy to serve a charitable cause, The Landmark Trust attract new
audiences on the Optimizely Digital Experience Platform

## Transition for long-term digital success

The Landmark Trust is one of Britainâ€™s leading building conservation charities.
It rescues precious pieces of our past and gives them a new life as holiday
lets. Today, The Landmark Trust have 200 historic buildings in its care with
over 70,000 guests every year.

The Landmark Trust engaged Optimizely partner, Netcel in a long-term partnership
to:

- Future-proof their digital estate
- Enhance booking conversion rates
- Attract a new generation of guests

Initial deliverables were to migrate and support the existing site, upgrade to
the latest version of Optimizely CMS, and to develop a mobile-responsive user
interface.

By designing a new responsive front-end experience, The Landmark Trust could
greatly improve conversion rates which, in turn, would help to justify future
investment in digital technology. Rather than a large-scale redesign, Netcel
recommended quick, smaller scale improvements such as redesigning the header,
using Optimizely supported solutions to enhance and optimize the customer
booking experience.

Netcel made the process smooth and stress free. They continue to challenge us as
a strategic digital partner, making sure we spend wisely to maximise our
investments.

The improved website saw immediate results in both site performance and
conversion rates and the responsive build saw a six-week ROI pay-back:

Netcel continues to consult on a long-term basis working in partnership with The
Landmark Trust to implement a roadmap of improvements to enhance the customer
experience, including adding online services such as becoming a member and
redeeming gift vouchers.
