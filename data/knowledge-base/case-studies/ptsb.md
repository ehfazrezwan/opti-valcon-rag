### **Modernizing digital presence with Optimizely**

Permanent TSB, one of Ireland’s leading banks, recognized the need to modernize
its digital presence to enhance customer experience and drive business growth.
By partnering with Optimizely and digital experience experts UNRVLD, PTSB aimed
to develop a robust digital experience and management platform. This strategic
initiative was designed to boost customer engagement, increase conversion rates,
and minimize the need for in-branch visits. The collaboration set the stage for
a transformative digital rebrand that would align with PTSB’s evolving market
position.

### **Aiming for enhanced engagement and streamlined interactions**

The primary objective of the project was to create a digital platform that not
only improved user engagement but also streamlined customer interactions,
enabling them to access services online more efficiently. As PTSB expanded its
role as a full-service, customer-focused personal and business bank, it became
clear that a new visual identity was necessary. Optimizely provided the
technological foundation, while UNRVLD was tasked with crafting a modern,
customer-centric identity that would resonate with PTSB’s diverse client base.

### **Delivering a consistent and intuitive digital experience**

UNRVLD successfully delivered a cohesive and visually striking online presence
by integrating Optimizely’s Content Management System (CMS) with meticulously
developed digital style guides. This integration ensured that PTSB’s new visual
identity was not only consistent but also seamlessly aligned with the bank’s
updated market position. The intuitive user interface, powered by Optimizely,
allows customers to easily access live information and self-service tools
tailored to their unique financial needs, creating a welcoming and efficient
digital environment.

### **Comprehensive digital solutions powered by Optimizely**

The collaboration between Optimizely, UNRVLD, and PTSB yielded significant
outputs, including advanced UX & UI design, the development of a flexible
Optimizely CMS, and seamless integration with PTSB’s internal banking systems.
The project also supported multiple digital initiatives, such as the creation of
online booking platforms, various financial calculators, and different account
applications, all designed to enhance customer interactions.

### **Empowering PTSB’s digital future with Optimizely**

At the core of this transformation was Optimizely’s powerful CMS, which provided
the flexibility and scalability needed to support PTSB’s growing digital needs.
The platform’s robust features empowered PTSB’s content teams to efficiently
manage digital content, ensuring that customers always had access to the most
relevant and up-to-date information. The successful implementation of
Optimizely’s CMS and the new digital identity enabled Permanent TSB to offer a
more personalized and engaging banking experience. This transformation not only
strengthened customer trust but also positioned PTSB as a leader in the digital
banking space in Ireland, prepared for continued innovation and growth.
