# American Paper competes with big box retailers

## A level of service passed down from generation to generation

A wholesale supplier and distributor of janitorial, packaging, disposable food
service, safety and office products, American Paper & Twine (APT) prides itself
on delivering a level of service that has been faithfully passed down from
generation to generation. Nearly a century ago, Nathan Doochin and Milton
Lockenbach found opportunity in the expanding Nashville wholesale market with
one truck, a big idea and a singular focus on customer service.

Headquartered in Nashville, APT now has over 300 employees and operates seven
(7) full-service distribution centers servicing the bulk of the Southeastern
United States.

APT attributes their success to satisfied and loyal customers, dedicated
employees, a superior work ethic and the highest level of customer service.

To continue satisfying their customers and compete with online “Big Box”
retailers, APT needed to deliver a more sophisticated eCommerce experience.

## From an ERP storefront to a best-in-class purchasing experience

APT began their eCommerce journey leveraging an ERP storefront. The solution
proved to be limiting with outdated functionality. APT needed to offer their
customers an online purchasing experience that provided a higher level of B2B
functionality including budgeting, order approvals and list management
capabilities.

As APT operates a rapidly growing business, Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud was
the perfect platform to bring their business into the future. APT’s website now
provides:

- Tools allowing customers to manage their procurement process
- Real-time pricing and inventory
- Detailed product information for more than 80,000 SKUs
- Punchout for improved user experience
- Analytics to optimize underperforming markets
- Improved marketing and promotional capabilities

Our customers were comparing us to the big box stores, expecting a high level of
functionality for the ordering and delivery of our products and services. We
needed to partner with an eCommerce provider that we trusted and was
technologically savvy.

## The new world with Optimizely

Since implementing B2B Commerce Cloud, APT has seen numerous benefits. Customer
Service Representatives are taking less calls, which in turn has increased their
capacity for more value-add customer assistance. In addition, APT is able to
drive lower priced commodity products online so representatives can spend their
time on higher value products.

Two years after implementing Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, APT saw more than a
$2M revenue gain and online year over year revenue growth was two times higher
for customers who ordered online.
