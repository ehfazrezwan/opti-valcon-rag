## Explore the capabilities of our warehouse-native analytics

What sets us apart

## _Connect_ with your data warehouse

Seamlessly integrate with the most popular data warehouses including Snowflake,
Databricks, Google BigQuery, and Amazon Redshift, for faster setup and data flow
management.

- **Connect instantly** to your data warehouse with ready-to-use integrations.
- **Map essential data** points and customize tables to make data readily available for experimentation.
- **Run health checks** to confirm connection stability and data readiness before diving into experiments.
- Ensure smooth data management across platforms for **accurate, real-time analysis**.

## _Build_ custom metrics

Create and customize a range of metric types to track, measure, and analyze
experiment outcomes in detail.

- Select from built-in metric templates: **Conversion Metrics** (track user actions), **Numeric Aggregations** (sum or average values), and **Calculated Metrics** (combine multiple metrics for more complex insights).
- Define metrics like revenue, page load time, or return rate, with the flexibility to sum, average, and aggregate values.
- Write formulas to create custom metrics, with basic arithmetic operations to calculate complex data, such as total realized revenue from various sources.

## Use the _experiment scorecard_

Analyze experiments with a comprehensive scorecard that gathers all essential
data for quick and effective decision-making.

- Select an experiment, then add primary and secondary metrics in a dedicated view to **tailor results to your needs**.
- **Automatically pull in experiment summary** information like Days Run, Total Visitors, Page Targeted, and more for a holistic view of each experiment.
- **See metric performance** by variation, with details on metric value, percentage improvement, confidence interval, and statistical significance.
- **Segment results** by user attributes (e.g., platform or country) to uncover how different audiences respond to experiments.

## Unlock native _analytics views_

Unlock deeper insights into user behavior with built-in analytics views designed
to support detailed journey and funnel analysis.

- **Visualize user flows** with funnel views to track how users progress through each step toward conversion.
- Use path views to **analyze the sequences users take** to and from conversion events, capturing both entry and exit points.
- **Explore trends** over time and segment data within dashboards, which can be shared across your team for strategic decision-making.

## Pre-built connectors with the world’s leading data warehouse providers

This is super exciting, and I already see how we can use this on the fly. It
will save us hours. My analysts will be over the moon for this.

Tapestry

We define our own sessions, and we define our own metrics. Everything already
sits in our warehouse as a single source of truth.

Chewy

This is the holy grail of visualization that a lot of analytics tools don't
have. This is awesome, especially if you can show the difference [in journeys]
between different variants and your test vs. control groups. This is something
we have never had. It's a very heavy lift and will save a lot of operation time
from my analytics team.
