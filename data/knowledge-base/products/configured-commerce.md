B2B is...complex...with factors like customer contracts, special pricing,
promotion, personalization, and deliveries to multiple branches. We needed to
partner with a company that was in the B2B space and understood its
complexities.

It's rare to find a platform that allows you to take a customer-centric view
rather than a campaign-centric one. We do not have to deal with complex workflow
diagrams or flowcharts for multi-touchpoint campaigns. We can understand the
conversion and revenue impact of each touchpoint and put the customer, rather
than the channel, first.
