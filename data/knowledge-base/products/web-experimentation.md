We’re using Optimizely Web Experimentation to test this page’s headline.

See how it works—and how you can use it on your own site!

#### Don’t guess, test

Let customer engagement drive your decisions, stop guessing what will convert​.

#### Maintain speed

Experiment without sacrificing performance by using an easily implemented, no-
flicker snippet.

#### Increase revenue

Lower customer acquisition costs without increasing ad spend or developer
workload.

Optimizely Web Experimentation structures our thought process on how to think
about new ideas and how to implement them, while giving us a safe way to
actually find which ideas are successful and which ones aren't.

We are able to identify what development work is worth pursuing and what isn't
based on the experiment results deployed by their platform.

Experimentation is a central part of our growth story. It’s really the pulse and
heartbeat of the business. Optimizely has really played a central role in
helping us become more disciplined and focused about the way that we do
experiments and ultimately drive growth in the business.

### Collaborate with everyone

Experimentation works best when tapping into everyone's creativity. Shared
workspaces give teams the same tools to craft hypotheses, variations and more,
while highly-visual (and shareable) calendars help track all in-flight and
upcoming activity. Need more experiment ideas? Crowdsource ideas with
customizable intake forms — and then turn those ideas into winning variations.

- Idea submission forms & backlog
- Workflows, variation design tools, approval checklists
- Shareable calendars & results repository

### Design with ease

Anyone can design beautiful experiments with low code and Extension templates
that reduce reliance on developers. An elegant visual editor helps you target
any element on your page and preview changes, while embedded AI capabilities
suggest copy variations based on call-to-action messaging. From technical
experts to more general users, Optimizely Web Experimentation meets you wherever
you are.

- Visual editor & on-page preview
- Multi-page & multivariate tests
- AI content suggestions

### Execute with speed

Use Optimizely's industry-leading, performance-focused Stats Accelerator (Multi-
armed bandit model) to attain the fastest, most statistically sound results. Run
experiments from the network edge for a swift user experience, then use AI to
automatically identify and optimize traffic distribution to significant
variations. Target the exact audience you want by defining segments based on
1st-party behavioral and 3rd-party demographic data from your Optimizely Data
Platform or another Customer Data Platform.

### Analyze with precision

Optimizely's proprietary Stats Engine helps you reach experiment learnings
faster while improving the accuracy of results and outcomes. See those results
in one configurable dashboard to make statistically sound decisions as soon as
the data starts coming in (peek whenever you like without affecting results),
and easily integrate into your analytics tools to streamline your tech stack
connections and ensure data consistency.
