    "content": "# Amerhart makes a paradigm shift with B2B Commerce\n\n## Inspiring Americans to Chase Their Dreams Since 1940\n\nA white picket fence surrounding a 3-story house, a beautiful car and a high\npaying job. Every individual has a different version of their American dream.\nOver time, those dreams evolve.\n\nAmerhart, a Midwest distributor of lumber and building materials, has been\ncommitted to working with people and communities to attain their American dreams\nsince 1940 – whether that’s a new home, a deck or a complete kitchen remodel.\n\nJust as dreams evolve, so too does technology. For a company that’s been in\nbusiness for 75 years, it would be easy to fall back on doing business the way\nthey’ve always done it. But that’s not the culture Amerhart has built. They’re\nshifting their business to account for advanced technology and evolving customer\nexpectations. Amerhart is making a paradigm shift.\n\n## A commitment to change and service beyond the order\n\nAmerhart is laser-focused on improving the lives of customers, employees and\ncommunities. Their promise goes Beyond the Order. Their service model is focused\non providing a superior customer experience, from before an order is placed to\nafter delivery occurs.\n\nHowever, leadership at Amerhart has an understanding of the changing landscape.\nCustomer expectations are evolving. The workforce is getting younger. More and\nmore, people prefer to transact electronically when they can. Sales\nrepresentatives are itching for more productive tools to do their jobs. That’s\nwhy Amerhart isn’t afraid of change.\n\nEngrained in Amerhart’s culture is the idea of “bleeding [Amerhart] green.”\nEmployees are willing to do whatever is in the best interests of Amerhart, but\nchange still takes time. Over the last year and a half, Amerhart has introduced\na lot of technology. They’ve deployed an Intranet, increased the use of\ncollaboration tools to enhance communication across 10 branch locations, and\ntransformed Amerhart.com from a static website to a dynamic online store focused\non delivering the best possible user experience.\n\nIt speaks volumes about the culture at Amerhart. People are loyal. They’re all\ncommitted to the same end goal. They want to deliver the best possible\nexperience for their customers. They want the company to be profitable,\nsustainable and forward-thinking.\n\nAmerhart first launched its ecommerce journey by deploying an online system\nbuilt on a legacy platform provided by their ERP vendor. While the platform\nprovided a tactical solution, it didn’t fully address the broader strategic\ngoals the company had for ecommerce, and it could not provide the experiences\ncustomers expected. Product descriptions, searchability, account accessibility\nand personalization capabilities were just some of the limitations Amerhart\nsought to overcome.\n\nWhile maintaining the personalized level of services its long-time customers\nvalued, Amerhart noticed that younger buyers who were entering the workplace\nwanted a more consumer-like feel when placing their orders electronically.\nAmerhart knew it was time to reinvest and build something better. Led by CEO,\nMark Kasper, they composed a team of ecommerce decision-makers including VP of\nIT, Rick Johnson, VP of Finance, Chad Warpinski and Director of IT Services,\nNate Wotruba.\n\nThe team knew they needed a platform that would offer them fully functional\necommerce capabilities.\n\n## The hunt for the right B2B ecommerce platform\n\nAmerhart wanted an ecommerce provider that was nimble and agile - a company that\nwould put Amerhart first and listen to them for product feedback. Amerhart also\nknew that there was an important distinction between B2B and B2C ecommerce. They\nlooked into platforms that were more B2C friendly like Magento, but trusted that\nthey needed a B2B-based platform.\n\nAmerhart searched for a platform that could accommodate the complexities of B2B,\nincluding capabilities for search, cart and checkout, integration to their PIM,\ninRiver and integration to their ERP, to name a few.\n\nGaining control of their product information was another important aspect of the\necommerce journey for Amerhart. Integrating the PIM with the ecommerce platform\nenables rich product information like product attributes to seamlessly flow to\nthe site.\n\nAmerhart’s site built on Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud would enable customers to\neasily self-serve, increase the team’s efficiencies, and help Amerhart deliver\nthe unique and personalized content experiences their customers and prospects\nexpected.\n\n## A paradigm shift improves the bottom line\n\nSince incorporating B2B Commerce Cloud, Amerhart has made major strides. It’s\nclear that Amerhart has met the mark with their online offering. Today, Amerhart\nhas over 4,000 registered users and aggressive goals to onboard and activate new\ncustomers.\n\nA survey Amerhart conducted following the release of B2B Commerce Cloud revealed\nthat customers were very likely to recommend amerhart.com. In fact, on a scale\nof 1-10, the average likelihood to recommend the site was 8.7.\n\nThe same survey gave Amerhart some helpful insight into what customers enjoyed\nabout the site and what they would like to see improved.\n\nWhen asked what Amerhart could do better online, one customer said, “Nothing.\nYou already have way more information available to me online than any other\ncompany in the industry.”\n\nAnother customer said, “Your online ordering tools are excellent and easy to\nuse.”\n\nFeedback on the site has been overwhelmingly positive. Since launching in\nFebruary 2019, Amerhart has grown exponentially month-over-month. An openness to\nchange and a commitment to delivering the highest quality customer service are\nkey factors that have made the ecommerce journey so successful.\n\nBefore implementing the new solution, order taking was labor-intensive.

Following the\nlegalization of Cannabis, ANBL received the mandate to be sole seller in the\nprovince, including online and instore purchases under its subsidiary Cannabis\nNB.\n\nWith access to a newly formed marketplace, ANBL wanted to capture and understand\ntheir consumers profiles. This way, they could smartly recommend not only the\nright product and tools but give curated advice on the complete experience\nwhilst complying with legislation.\n\nThe challenges of this mandate included an accelerated timeline and the need for\nstrict compliance with regulations for the commercialization of cannabis.\nCannabis NB was also required to provide detailed educational information about\ncannabis products and their effects, as part of a strong social responsibility\nmission.\n\nANBL was facing strong pressure to launch and support a complete new line of\nbusiness in less than 6 months. The challenging timeline to meet imposed federal\ngovernment legal deadline combined with advanced retail omni-channel\nrequirements made it critical for us to choose the right platform and partner to\nachieve such an endeavour. The Optimizely platform combined with the Microsoft\nDynamics 365 for Retail capabilities enabled us not just to meet our deadlines\nbut also to face extreme peaks during launch.\n\nDwayne Chase\n\nDirector of Information Technology, Alcool NB Liquor\n\n## Solution\n\nIt was this need for a content-rich platform, in addition to a robust commerce\nexperience, that made Optimizely Digital Experience Platform and Microsoft\nDynamics 365 the right choice. ANBL selected Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance\n& Operations, natively integrated with Optimizely Digital Experience Platform,\nfor its cannabis retail solution under the subsidiary Cannabis NB.\n\nBesides the quick time-to-market, the cloud-based platform answered scalability\nrequirements. The Digital Experience Platform infrastructure allowed ANBL to\nexperience peaks during heavy online transactions. Its capabilities provide a\nseamless, user friendly operation that enables a nimble client team to operate\nand manage the platform.\n\nANBL took advantage of the platforms ability to facilitate multiple integrations\nto third party systems (Payment solutions, 3-PLs, suppliers for product\ninformation) equipping the retailer with the digital ecosystem needed to exceed\ncustomer needs. The Optimizely native integration with Dynamics 365 for Retail\nand Modern POS in the Microsoft Azure Cloud were fundamental to succeed.\n\nThe unified operation and experience approach across omnichannel was critical in\nproviding a seamless experience for customers. ANBL were also able to manage and\nadhere to legislation restrictions and respect regulations easily and quickly.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nThe solution was built in less than 6 months, and now fully supports the\nprovince’s cannabis online and retail sales operations, including:\n\n- product and catalog management\n- payment and checkout\n- comprehensive educational content\n- operations management for 20 physical stores\n\nA key part of Cannabis NB’s mandate was to understand consumer intentions and\nobjectives when using cannabis, so it could recommend the right products and\ntools for the customer. Optimizely uses advanced AI to personalize content for\nevery single visitor, a feature that could be leveraged in the future to meet\nthis objective.\n\nBy fully complying with legislation, ANBL is helping guide consumers on the type\nand amount of product, point out potential side effects, and act as ambassadors\nfor responsible cannabis use.\n\nThe platform is scalable for future needs. After launch, additional omnichannel\nscenarios (buy online for in-store pick up; ship to home from store; and\ndistributed order management) are being developed to enhance customer\nexperience.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Commerce Connect\n- Configured Commerce",

But they needed a partner that could translate and deliver\na meaningful experience across their entire digital ecosystem.\n\nPioneering a next generation hybrid model in hospitality, TSH is an urban\nregenerator. They partner with cities to create new communities based around a\nblend of co-living, student and hotel accommodation, with co-working, private\noffice and meeting spaces; enriched with lifestyle options across wellness,\nentertainment, event, bar and restaurant spaces.\n\nThey needed to redefine their digital experience and overhaul their\ninfrastructure to enterprise-standard solutions, in response to rapid expansion\nand an increasingly complex product mix. Crucially, the new infrastructure had\nto be scalable, robust and enable innovative digital experiences that blend\nseamlessly with physical environments. In turn, driving sustained competitive\nadvantage, resilience and growth.\n\nCommunity is at the centre of everything TSH does – from how they build\nproperties to how people experience them. From the students that live there to\nweekend travellers, co-workers, coffee-grabbers, and everyone in between, they\nare all part of the Complete Connected Community. The experiences driven by the\nnew digital ecosystem needed to reflect this, connecting nearly a million\ncurrent and former co-living and co-working guests. The aim was to use the best\nof digital to remove boundaries and create a feeling of community between all\nthose who consider themselves a ‘student at heart’.\n\n## Visionary thinking\n\nOptimizely partner, Rufus Leonard employed their Experience Playbook process to\ncreate an inspiring blueprint defining The Student Hotel’s industry-leading\ndigital experience. The Experience Playbook captures a customer-centric yet\nbrand-led and technology-enabled vision. It’s a tool that translates business\nstrategy into meaningfully differentiated customer experiences. As well as\nproviding an inspiring ‘north star’, the Experience Playbook continues to add\nvalue as a tool for TSH stakeholders to use with investors and partners as the\nbusiness grows.\n\nApplying their own experience design expertise to collaborative research and\nideation, Rufus Leonard established a backlog of ideas and concepts to explore\nand rationalise. Their approach to this was a balance between requirement-driven\noutputs (e.g. for transactional journeys such as room booking) and conceptual\ndesign thinking (e.g. app-based functionality for innovative experiences, such\nas automated check-in and digital room keys). They worked with TSH to score and\nprioritise the backlog of experience concepts into a delivery roadmap that would\ndeliver maximum value against the overarching objectives.\n\nRufus Leonard had the proven credentials to engineer our core digital platforms\nto deliver our desired distinctive experience. This milestone is the first step\nin our digital transformation from offering a collection of individual products,\nto a seamless lifelong customer experience integrating a complex mix of\nhospitality products, lifestyle services and learning experiences. The solution\ndelivers more than an enhanced brand experience, including significant\noperational efficiency, scalability and – critical in these times – speed to\nmarket\n\nMark Liversidge\n\nChief Digital & Experience, The Student Hotel\n\n## Embarking on an intensive launch program\n\nThe team embarked on an intensive launch program to deliver a complete digital\nexperience designed for the modern digital native.\n\nThe result is an experience with dynamic contextual navigation, built on mobile-\nfirst principles, that supports accessibility in all its forms, and delivers a\ndifferentiated brand experience – performing impeccably and reliably at all\ntimes. Underpinning the experience is an innovative hybrid hospitality UX that\nis user-centric and goal-orientated, rather than one-size-fits-all. The site\nuses a digital design language that can adapt to any device, enabling a\nconsistent look-and-feel no matter the brand touchpoint.\n\nOne of the key principles of our architecture was to enable a seamless\nexperience across devices. The team sort about creating an overarching design\nlanguage system that ensured common and consistent design and interaction\npatterns across channels and devices, powered by Optimizely Content Cloud. It\nall started by exploring design concepts for mobile app, web, wearables and in-\nroom AV, and refined these into a design language system and core UI library,\ngiving direction on colour, type, padding & shading, iconography, imagery and\ninteractive UI elements. This enabled a consistent look-and-feel no matter what\nthe brand touchpoint.\n\n## Supporting TSH’s hyper-growth while inspiring their diverse and future-\n\nfocused international community\n\nThe technical ecosystem architecture is anchored on a headless, omni-channel,\nmulti-language platform. It is built on future-focused foundations, uniquely\nbuilding in Optimizely DXP and React. With additional functionality supported by\nRufus’ Omnichannel Experience.API.\n\nAs well as its well-known and easy to use content editing capabilities,\nOptimizely Digital Experience Platform was selected for its mature content API\nthat includes A/B testing and personalisation, as well as reliable and available\nhosting. All of which will help power the headless omnichannel content ambition\nglobally\n\nThe headless single page application (SPA), enabled by React, allows TSH to\nserve the content stored in the Optimizely CMS to any number of front-end\nchannels: website, apps, voice interfaces, hotel lobby screens, in-room TVs –\nyou name it.

The organization also lacked the ability to run experiments and\npersonalize its website based on user behavior and preferences.\n\n#### **Limited data and insights**\n\nRoad Scholar had limited access to data and insights on its website performance\nand customer behavior, which made it difficult to measure the impact of its\ncontent and marketing efforts and optimize its digital strategy\n\n# Using the best of Optimizely One to drive real value\n\n#### **Content Marketing Platform (CMP)**\n\nTo streamline its content creation, management processes and content supply\nchain, Road Scholar implemented Optimizely CMP, which enabled them to plan,\ncollaborate, and execute campaigns and content within a single integrated\nplatform.\n\n#### **Content Management System (CMS)**\n\nTo improve its website speed, functionality, and flexibility, Road Scholar\nmigrated its website from its previous content management platform to\nOptimizely’s CMS, which offered faster load times, easier content updates, and\nmore options to deliver content.\n\n#### **Web Experimentation**\n\nRoad Scholar switched from their previous testing platform to Optimizely Web\nExperimentation, which enabled them to A/B test and optimize their website\ncontent and campaigns, run multivariate/multi-armed bandit tests, measure the\nimpact of their changes on key metrics and deliver personalized experiences to\ntheir diverse and growing audience.\n\n#### **Optimizely Data Platform (ODP)**\n\nTo gain more insights and visibility into its website performance and customer\nbehavior, Road Scholar utilized Optimizely Data Platform, which provided them\nwith real-time data and analytics on their experiments, campaigns, and content.\n\n#### **Recommendations**\n\nTo personalize its website and offer relevant and engaging content to its\ncustomers, Road Scholar leveraged Optimizely Recommendations, which uses machine\nlearning to provide tailored suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.\n\n#### **Experimentation Collaboration**\n\nThe experimentation collaboration feature has played a pivotal role in Road\nScholar’s testing process, facilitating effective communication and coordination\namong team members across different geographical locations and teams. This\nfeature enabled Road Scholar to implement a streamlined workflow from test idea\nsubmissions to execution and reporting.\n\n# Key results since using Optimizely\n\n> **Increased efficiency:** Road Scholar has dramatically reduced its content\n> creation and deployment time thanks to the user-friendly and streamlined\n> capabilities of Optimizely CMP and CMS.\n> **Improved website performance:** Road Scholar improved its website page load\n> speed by 38%, which has improved the user experience and reduced bounce rates\n> **Higher conversion rates and revenue:** Road Scholar increased its conversion\n> rates by 30% from March 2023 to March 2024 (including mobile) as a result of\n> its experiments and personalization efforts using Optimizely Web\n> Experimentation and Recommendations\n\n## **Background**\n\nFounded in 1975, Road Scholar offers thousands of educational travel programs\nacross the United States and in nearly 100 countries across the globe, covering\ntopics such as history, culture, nature, music, art, and more. Road Scholar\nserves nearly 100,000 participants each year, who are mostly adults aged 55 and\nolder.\n\nRoad Scholar encountered several critical challenges with their existing CMS\nplatform. The outdated system significantly lacked the modern look and feel\nneeded to attract and retain users, and making any changes to the website was a\ncomplex process that necessitated extensive developer involvement. This lack of\nan active CMS meant that content creators could not independently update content\nor create new pages, resulting in inefficiency and slowed responsiveness to\nevolving needs.\n\nAdditionally, the system lacked the flexibility and customizability required to\ngrow with the organization. It was not scalable, posing a barrier to future\ndevelopment and adaptation. The burden of maintaining security updates and other\nnecessary updates internally further strained Road Scholar's resources.\n\nMoreover, Road Scholar's project management and content approval processes were\ncumbersome. They used separate systems for task tracking and approvals, which\nresulted in inefficiencies and redundant efforts. The marketing team had to\nmanage editing and proofing through disparate PDFs, leading to a fragmented and\ntime-consuming approval process.\n\nIn their direct marketing efforts, including extensive catalog and print\nmarketing, Road Scholar heavily relied on testing to understand customer\npreferences. However, their existing web experimentation platform, fell short in\nproviding the robustness needed to accelerate testing across various pages and\nsupport complex, simultaneous tests. This limitation hindered their ability to\neffectively leverage data-driven insights to optimize their marketing\nstrategies.\n\nFacing these multifaceted challenges, Road Scholar realized the need for a\ncomprehensive and integrated solution that could streamline their content\nmanagement, enhance workflow efficiency, and provide a robust platform for web\nexperimentation. This need for an adaptable, scalable, and integrated digital\nexperience platform led them to choose Optimizely.\n\n**Solution**\n\nSince adopting Optimizely's integrated suite of products, Road Scholar has\nexperienced transformative improvements in their digital capabilities and\noperational efficiency.

Leveraging the comprehensive tools provided by\nOptimizely, Road Scholar has created a more dynamic and engaging digital\nexperience for its users.\n\nFrom my perspective, Optimizely One has made things so much easier. For vendor\nmanagement, I don't have to negotiate multiple contracts or find the best\nsolution across different platforms. I don't have to struggle with custom coding\nto integrate various platforms. Also, having systems that can communicate\nseamlessly without having to learn another system really helps. I don't need to\nmaintain separate passwords or have training for different platforms. My team\ncan communicate with each other, whether it's the content team or the developer\ngroup, all in one place\n\nMark Fagiano\n\nSenior e-Commerce Director\n\n## **Content Marketing Platform**\n\nOptimizely's CMP has revolutionized Road Scholar's content creation and\nmanagement processes. With around 75 users on CMP, including 20-25 core content\ncreators and the rest involved in approvals and editing, the platform has\nsignificantly enhanced collaboration. The shared editing capabilities and\nvisibility into the entire content creation process ensure everyone stays\naligned. Customizable workflows allow for streamlined task management, reducing\nbottlenecks and enhancing productivity.\n\nDigital Asset Management (DAM) integration allows Road Scholar to manage over\n50,000 assets, including images and, soon, videos. The integration between CMP\nand DAM allows for seamless access and deployment of these assets, improving the\nspeed and efficiency of content creation and publication. Extensive use of work\nrequests and task management features in CMP has optimized workflows,\nparticularly for web testing. This integration has improved the management and\nexecution of experiments, leading to more efficient and effective testing\nprocesses.**Content Management System**\n\nOptimizely's CMS has provided Road Scholar with a robust, secure, and flexible\nplatform for managing their digital content. The CMS's stability and security\nare critical for Road Scholar, especially as they continuously upgrade their\n.NET environment. The ability to move into more code-friendly environments has\nallowed for a complete rebuild of their website, resulting in faster load times\nand improved overall performance.\n\nThe fully supported and customizable nature of the CMS has enabled Road Scholar\nto set specific usage rules and manage content more efficiently. This\ncustomization ensures that the CMS meets their unique needs, providing a\ntailored solution that enhances their digital strategy. The seamless integration\nbetween CMP and CMS ensures a streamlined process from content creation to\npublication. This integration reduces the need for multiple third-party systems\nand provides a unified workflow, enhancing efficiency and reducing the total\ncost of ownership.\n\nOne of the things I'm really enjoying is the Optimizely One ecosystem. Having\nall of those components that speak to one another is a huge advantage for us.\nIntegrating CMP with Optimizely Web Experimentation has been critical. Now, we\nhave our workflows for testing in CMP, with a whole work request stream\nfunctioning as our testing backlog.\n\nMark Fagiano\n\nSenior e-Commerce Director\n\n## **Web Experimentation**\n\nOptimizely Web Experimentation has empowered Road Scholar to conduct\nsophisticated A/B and multivariate testing with greater efficiency and\neffectiveness. The ease of setting up tests and the streamlined workflow the\nintegration with CMP provides has significantly reduced friction and accelerated\nthe testing process, highlighted by the fact that the number of tests conducted\nmonthly by Road Scholar has doubled, from approximately 5 to 10.\n\nThe web experimentation platform integrates seamlessly with CMP via the\nExperiment Collaboration feature, enabling a streamlined workflow from test idea\nsubmission to execution and reporting. This integration includes a\nprioritization process and visibility into the testing queue, ensuring that all\nexperiments are managed efficiently. Optimizely’s experimentation platform\nprovides more control at the code level for experiments and allows for the\ncreation of custom metrics for reporting. This flexibility enables Road Scholar\nto tailor their testing and measurement strategies to meet specific goals and\nobjectives.\n\n## **Use Case 1 – Multi-armed bandit checkout flow test**\n\nRoad Scholar has experienced significant benefits since implementing\nOptimizely's Web Experimentation product, particularly in managing complex tests\nwithin their checkout flow. One such example is the introduction of a feature\nallowing customers to save their credit card payment profile and opt into\nautomatic payments. This was a substantial change requiring coordination across\nthe organization, particularly with the development team, to ensure seamless\nintegration and minimal disruption to the checkout process.\n\nGiven their older demographic, averaging 72 years old, Road Scholar was\nconcerned about potential confusion and decreased conversion rates. By utilizing\nOptimizely's multi-arm bandit feature, they were able to roll out the test to a\nsmall subset of visitors initially, mitigating risks and allowing for careful\nmonitoring. This level of sophistication and flexibility in experimentation\nwould have been unattainable with their previous platform, highlighting the\nsignificant advantage Optimizely provides in executing complex tests and driving\ninformed decision-making.\n\n_Road Scholar's Auto Payment Page_**Optimizely Data Platform and\nRecommendations**\n\nThe integration of ODP and Recommendations has significantly enhanced Road\nScholar's personalization and marketing efforts. ODP integrates data from\nvarious sources, including phone orders and demographic overlays, providing a\nholistic view of each customer. This comprehensive data allows for highly\ntargeted and personalized marketing efforts, enhancing user engagement and\nconversion rates.\n\nThe Recommendations engine promotes",

    "content": "# Moco Food Services\n\nFoodservice distributor creates B2C experiences for B2B\n\nMulti-award winning Moco Food Services is a foodservice distributor supplying\nmajor consumer brands products such as Nestle and Unilever to customers\nincluding pubs, clubs, restaurants and cafes. They are the prominent name in the\nB2B food distribution industry trading out of the East Coast of Australia.\n\nMoco’s state-of-the-art distribution center houses some of the sharpest\nwarehousing and logistical efficiencies in Australia. The company has invested\nheavily in its technology infrastructure to enhance operations across its\nwarehouse including voice picking, live inventories on hand and forklifts with\nautomated routing software.\n\n## Distributing new advances\n\nMoco wanted a system that would better accommodate users and encourage more to\nuse it, as many of its customers were ordering through its call center. With\nsignificant advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence, the\ncompany wanted to find a technology partner that would advise and assist in\nthose areas.\n\n## Validation through customer research\n\nMoco employed a holistic approach in setting out their vision that centered it\naround an immersive visitor experience.\n\nThe distributor commissioned customer research and spent three months\ninterviewing their extensive customer network. Craig Purnell, Chief Operating\nOfficer at Moco pointed out \"our customers wanted something online that makes it\neasy to order, gives them inspiration and provides customized offerings.’’\n\nCraig also noted, “Once we had this feedback it was an easy decision for us as\nwe knew this was the journey we wanted to go on, and we needed to keep our\ncustomers happy!”\n\n## Emulating B2C experiences\n\nMoco’s research concluded that customers desired a journey that reflected their\nevery day, online shopping experiences as a consumer. Customers expect B2B\ndistributors to offer a B2C experience.\n\nThis alone made Moco’s existing platform obsolete for customer needs. The\nbusiness’ current ordering platform was one dimensional – not meeting increasing\ncustomer expectations. Having been designed solely as an ordering platform and\nnot as a user interface for enjoyable user experience, it wasn’t appealing to\nvisitors.\n\n“Being a progressive business, we wanted to change the current platform because\nit was not where we wanted it to be as a business,\" says Craig Purnell, Chief\nOperating Officer, Moco Food Services.\n\nMoco had set out an ambitious yet comprehensive platform requirement. One which\nwould better accommodate current users’ needs and attract new users to visit. It\nneeded to be fast, with a powerful search functionality and space to showcase\nthousands of products in an easily accessible manner.\n\n- Speed to order - a fast platform at processing information\n- A powerful search functionality\n- Product information, detail and attributes easily accessible.\n\n## Optimizely's personalization solution\n\nTo satisfy market demands and maintain exponential growth, Moco Food Services\ntoday leverages a suite of Optimizely solutions.\n\n\"We like Episerver’s [now Optimizely] integrated approach, development\nlifecycle, and comprehensive modules,\" says Craig on the value Optimizely\ndelivers for his organization.Benefiting from a single, unified digital\necosystem, Moco smartly deploys Optimizely as a central module that integrates\nwith numerous platforms to ensure smooth 24/7 operations. From payment systems\nto delivery tracking, the Optimizely Digital Experience Platform handles all of\nMoco’s capability requirements.\n\nBefore the upgrade to Optimizely, the analog ordering process meant that\ncustomers purchased the same items repeatedly. Their attention wasn’t drawn to\nother items that would be of use to them. Unleashing machine learning through\nOptimizely’s Personalization suite has enabled Moco to showcase its entire\npallet of products. It is not only Moco who benefits from a unified platform\nexperience. Their customers often remark that they \"weren’t aware of Moco’s\nextensive range.\" This higher visibility has led to an increased likelihood of\ncustomers purchasing more items from Moco, valuing the company as a one-stop-\nshop. Influencing an increase in purchases, this has grown Moco’s revenues while\ndriving efficiencies for the customer as they now receive one supplier invoice.\n\nAs Moco builds out their customer personas and uncovers rich customer data, the\npersonalization venture continues, ensuring super-accurate recommendations every\ntime.\n\n\"The personalization component is something that really aligns with our\nstrategic objectives,\" says Caroline Kelly, eCommerce Manager, Moco Food\nServices.\n\n## Pricing is paramount but no longer a game-changer\n\nAs Moco continues to set the precedence and disrupt the norm, industry\ncounterparts are catching wind of this. They, too, are deploying artificial\nintelligence solutions signaling an industry shifting away from a price-\norientated, transactional basis.\n\nThe traditional battlefield for B2B distributors was overwhelmingly centered\naround price. Large-scale hospitality customers commanded huge volumes that\nequated to price discounts. Moco is now better positioned to efficiently\naccommodate all customers - expertly crafting a rock-solid pricing strategy\nacross their entire product estate. This equals a browsing journey that\ntransitions the customer from search-to-order in just three clicks.\n\n## Unpacking the benefits and delivering behavioral change\n\nDuring the first five months of launch, 65% of orders were placed through the\nnew Optimizely platform. This marked an incredible take-up rate well ahead of\nthe business’ expectations and heralded a new digital era for the distributor’s\ncustomer base. This shift in behavior, away from traditional ordering methods,\nis on target to grow – expecting to deliver 85% in due course.\n\nWith smart automation following the ecommerce launch, Moco already enjoys a 10%\nreduction in error rates.

Barncancerfonden’s stated\nmission is to save as many children’s lives as possible and give everyone who is\ntouched by childhood cancer the best life that they can have. That applies to\nthe child, but also to their friends and loved ones\n\nBarncancerfonden sets out to achieve this by operating various fundraising\nactivities to raise money for cancer research and also to directly help both\nfamilies and hospital staff through what is always a difficult and costly\nprocess. Barncancerfonden raises approximately SEK 420 million (around €36\nmillion) every year and strives to influence politicians and people in power to\nmake the responsible decisions that will help children and families have a\nbright future.\n\nBarncancerfonden launched more than 40 years ago, and Head of IT Martin Bergseth\nnotes that the amount of fundraising that takes place online has increased\nconsistently over the past decade. Since 2015, Barncancerfonden has worked\nalongside development partner Authority to host its website utilizing\nOptimizely’s Content Management System (CMS).**Gala night is the highlight of\nthe year**\n\nFor years, Barncancergalan, the annual Child Cancer Gala, has been\nBarncancerfonden’s single largest fundraising event and the highlight of the\nyear. The gala is broadcast on TV and live-streamed online, and viewers are\nencouraged to donate to support the worthy cause.\n\nAs Martin explained, all Barncancergalan donations are channeled through the\nBarncancerfonden website. Due to the increase in viewership and attention the\ngala provides, there an urgent need to boost site performance far beyond normal\nday-to-day levels. The gala itself is a two-hour event and Martin estimated that\nin those two hours, the website experiences approximately the same amount of\ntraffic as it ordinarily sees in a week. These visitors are not passive\ncustomers but people who are eager to make a donation.\n\n**Working together to make Barncancergalan a success**\n\nMartin detailed that Barncancerfonden’s donations system had previously to cope\nwith the sudden spike in donations during the gala. Inevitably, this problem\ngrew until it reached crisis point when the website servers almost crashed\nentirely.\n\nIn 2017, with Authority’s support, Barncancerfonden implemented this cloud\nsolution to increase capacity both during the gala, and in the weeks around it.\nOptimizely and Authority have come together to deliver a fast and reliable\nexperience for all users viewing the charity’s site, as well as making sure\nBarncancerfonden’s backend is up to the task of processing all donations that\nare transacted simultaneously.\n\nSince 2018, Barncancerfonden has had no issues whatsoever in dealing with the\nspike in demand when Barncancergalan takes place Martin says they scale up as\nnecessary from two to as many as 10 servers as demand dictates.**Why\nOptimizely?**\n\nWhen Authority stepped in as a development partner with Barncancerfonden,\nOptimizely’s CMS was being utilized by a previous partner. After assessing\nBarncancerfonden’s business needs and objectives, Authority decided that\nBarncancerfonden’s best course of action was to continue using Optimizely’s CMS.\n\nDimitris, Senior Program Manager at Authority, acknowledged that other content\nmanagement solutions were considered but stated that moving outside the\nOptimizely ecosystem was never given any serious consideration. Developers\nwithin both Authority and Barncancerfonden were familiar with Optimizely and the\nsolution had consistently delivered since its implementation, so there was no\ndriver or appetite for change.\n\nDimitris added that the editors at Barncancerfonden were accustomed to\nOptimizely’s intuitive and easy-to-use CMS. Optimizely’s CMS additional\nfunctionality by way of add-ons has proved extremely useful for\nBarncancerfonden. The **Search and Navigation** feature, allows Barncancerfonden\nto base search functionality on visitor search behavior and website statistics\nand guided search to increase website traffic. The **Authoring and Layout**\nfeature, which is used frequently by the Barncancerfonden team, allows content\ncreators and editors to easily create functional web pages using Optimizely’s\ndrag and drop functionality.\n\nDimitris also mentioned that the Language and Localization prompts have also\nproved very useful. He remarked: “In code level, we actually always think on the\nbasis that everything is going to be localized and then introduced in different\nlanguages.” Although most of the website is currently displayed in Swedish,\nvital areas such as the donation flow, have been translated to English.\n\nThe website is our most important channel when it comes to getting donations to\nBarncancerfonden so we’re really depending on Authority as a partner to help us.\nOptimizely’s CMS helps to bring a smooth, good experience to our donors on the\nweb. The gala serves as a perfect use case where our partnership truly shines.\n\nMartin Bergseth\n\nHead of IT\n\n## **Stability and security are watchwords**\n\nMartin and Dimitris agreed that high volume of traffic on the website combined\nwith the numerous integrations with",

Barncancerfonden store a large amount of personal\ndata in Salesforce which integrates with the Optimizely hosted website. The\nwebsite also integrates with Klarna, a direct payment provider.\n\nMartin acknowledged that keeping Barncancerfonden’s website “efficient, secure,\nand future proof” is critical for the company’s success and is something that\nwould be a lot harder to achieve without the security that Optimizely’s CMS\nprovides.\n\nDimitris added that Authority support Barncancerfonden’s security efforts by\nregularly examining application insights to identify performance issues or\nsecurity concerns that need to be addressed. Dimitris explained that\n“additionally, we conduct load tests prior to important events to ensure optimal\nperformance. We make use of a logging system to monitor and maintain the\nsecurity and stability of our platform.”**Streamlining Content Management**\n\nMartin commented that Optimizely’s CMS has dramatically improved content\ncreation at Barncancerfonden. He says that content for the website comes in from\ndiverse directions every day, including researchers, the marketing team, the\ncommunications department and so on. All have their words to share and messages\nto get across, and doing so without delay is a vital ingredient for consistent\nfundraising success.**Positive Customer Feedback**\n\nBarncancerfonden’s users are always asked to rate their experience on the\nwebsite. They are quizzed on such aspects as the ease of making a donation and\nease of access to relevant information. This feedback is something Martin’s team\ntracks over time to gauge performance and optimize the website.\n\nIn general, Martin has found the feedback to be “overwhelmingly positive.” He\nsays that on a scale of one to five, the average score for questions like the\nease of making a donation or satisfaction with the website is around 4.6. With\ncustomer satisfaction so high, Barncancerfonden’s internal teams can focus on\nimproving the customer experience rather than problem solving.\n\nMartin remarked: “It's great that our customers are highly satisfied with the\nservices we provide. This level of satisfaction indicates that our services are\nrunning smoothly and efficiently. As a result, our focus can be directed towards\nmaking incremental tweaks and improvements each year, rather than dealing with\nmajor issues or putting out fires.”**Looking ahead**\n\nRight now, Barncancerfonden is in the process of upgrading to Optimizely CMS 12,\nwith the aim of achieving a website experience that is even faster and smoother\nfor its users. But before long, all thoughts will turn to the 2023 Children’s\nGala at the end of September.\n\nAfter the gala, Barncancerfonden will be launching a large Christmas campaign.\nThis will kick off in October and will cover a range of Christmas-related\nactivities, mostly on the website. There will also be a whole new range of\nseasonal products in the Christmas gift shop, targeting companies and\nbusinesses. Martin explains that this year, Barncancerfonden will be focusing\nparticularly hard on encouraging companies to purchase business during the\nholiday season.\n\nLooking further ahead to 2024, Barncancerfonden also plan to redesign their\nwebsite in an attempt to refresh its branding and revamp the donation flow to\ncreate a seamless experience for its users.\n\nBarncancerfonden does amazing work for a wonderful cause. Optimizely is proud to\nplay its part as a trusted partner along with Authority and looks forward to\ncontinuing to do so in the months and years to come.\n\n#### Industry\n\nEducation\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

The service covers an area of 620\nsquare miles and a population of over 7 million residents.\n\nThe Met Police wanted to transition its existing engagement platform from a\nsimple publishing site into an operational police station, providing localised\nand specific content to the public. The new site was to become an interactive\nengagement tool to capture, process and complete crime reporting and engagement\nservices. A game-changer for a UK police force.\n\n## Direct engagement with the masses\n\nThe Met Police partnered with Optimizely partner CDS to create the new website.\nCMS functionality was utilised, whilst developing additional components through\nthe open API. The core transactional aspect of the solution was a bespoke forms\nengine, which was the backbone of the public engagement function. The solution\nenables the public to interact with the MPS on various aspects such as crime\nreporting and licence applications. There are many different types of crime and\neach question directs people, through logical branching, down a specific route,\nwhether to act or await a response from the appropriate person in the MPS who is\nalerted by the system. Along with the public engagement features the solution\ndelivers localised content related to Safer Neighbourhood Team (SNT) areas. This\nprovides a community level service whereby the public are informed about the\nmost prevalent crime trends and offered information about how to prevent and\navoid being a victim of those crime types, specific to each SNT area.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Service website delivers a fundamental transition from a\npublishing website to an operational police station. Website visitors are guided\nfrom the homepage toward logical, easy to use routes for specific tasks to\nenable them to: Report crime, view local statistics and crime prevention advice,\ncomplete transactions (such as license applications, apply for National Safety\nAwareness courses, feedback to the MPS) all end-to-end online and deliver a\nfully accessible service that is: mobile and desktop compatible, is truly usable\nfrom a web standards and disability/accessibility perspective, that is presented\nand authored in the language of a member of the public rather than as a member\nof the law enforcement community.\n\nGiven more choices and a newly developed leading-edge website the public is\nmoving from front desk and call centre to interacting with the Met online. The\nMet Police has seen a growth of 25% more people using online instead of the\nMet’s call centre. Each contact via the website, instead of call centre,\nachieved for the Metropolitan police is equivalent, according to industry\nfigures, to an approximate cashable saving of £9 for every transaction.\n\n#### Industry\n\nTech\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.met.police.uk/",

Mazda recently\ndecided that its website for the North American market was not sufficiently\nhelping customers research and select the right car.\n\n\"The customer experience has grown in importance,\" says Ben Rounsefell, Sr.\nManager, Digital, Customer Engagement at Mazda. \"The level of detail required to\nconfigure and find a product is an expectation on any modern vehicle website.\nBefore our digital transformation, the site we had was very hard to maintain. We\nmissed a lot of opportunities to grow with industry trends.\"\n\n## A user-friendly platform for global and local experiences\n\nTo solve this problem, Mazda contacted its creative partner, The Garage Team\nMazda, and global digital agency Mirum to begin developing a new site. At the\ncenter of the new site was the Optimizely platform.\n\n\"We knew that Optimizely was a pretty strong product from experience overseas,\"\nsays Rounsefell. \"Anything we do from a local point of view should be shareable\nglobally. Optimizely allows that flexibility.\"\n\n## New tools for a better customer journey\n\nWith the new site, Mazda shoppers can now easily research and select a vehicle\nwith fewer clicks, and for the first time from mobile devices. The content is\nrelevant and up to date, including reference materials for current owners.\n\n\"Our results were impressive,\" Rounsefell says. \"We have much higher engagement,\nsmooth navigation, and new features around locating a dealer from a proximity\npoint of view that we hadn't had before.\"\n\nIn the first two months after the site was launched, it had almost five million\nunique visitors and a 200 percent improvement in engagement.\n\n\"We went from an online brochure to a mobile-driven, data-driven immersive\nplatform,\" Rounsefell says. \"If I was being asked to recommend Optimizely, I\nwouldn't have a hesitation.

    "content": "# The art of taking omnichannel to the next level\n\nFor HiFi Klubben, omnichannel is a given. They know that selling premium audio\nonline requires physical stores. Customers want to be able to feel, see and\nlisten. So it doesn't matter whether a purchase is completed online or in the\nstore in town – the key thing is that the various channels support one another.\n\nAs part of greater redesign and strategy work, HiFi Klubben wanted to create the\nultimate omnichannel experience. The idea was that the five e-shops and the\nchain’s 95 physical stores in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and the\nNetherlands will be part of the same customer journey, without friction between\nchannels.\n\nTo implement the new venture, HiFi Klubben turned to Impact, e-commerce\nspecialists and Optimizely Gold Solution Partner in Denmark. Impact was given an\noverall task that included everything from strategic consulting, a new IT\narchitecture based on microservices to implementation, where a completely new\nwebsite was built with Optimizely as the engine.\n\nWith its new platform, HiFi Klubben has built up a large digital showroom filled\nwith inspiration and advice. The company is very careful to communicate quality\nhere as well, in order to dispel any uncertainty about buying exclusive audio\nsystems online.\n\nOne of the benefits of Optimizely, which means a lot to HiFi Klubben, is that\nthe platform supports multiple languages and enables coordinated campaigns.\nRelevant user roles have been defined, so that a number of editors in the\ndifferent countries can work together to produce attractive content about the\ncompany’s audio products.\n\nWith its new platform, HiFi Klubben has strengthened the collaboration between\ne-commerce and the physical stores, for example by allowing customers to collect\ntheir order in-store or book a free listening experience. On the product pages\nthey can see when the demo system is available and the stock status of the\nproducts. This strengthens the customers’ connection to HiFi Klubben and their\nlocal stores.\n\nIn parallel with the digital initiative, the physical stores have also been\nrefurbished. They are increasingly being used as demo rooms with a focus on the\nlistening experience. All items can be sent very quickly from the main\nwarehouse, either to the store or directly to the customer. Sales reps can\ncomplete a purchase anywhere in the store using tablet or mobile as the only\ntool.\n\n## **Product data enhances the purchasing experience**\n\nFor HiFi Klubben, it was important to develop the use of product data to\ndisseminate knowledge and radiate the same professionalism in digital channels\nthat customers have always experienced in physical stores.\n\nPreviously, product data was handled directly in the e-commerce platform, which\nlimited the use of the content to the actual website. Communication, file\ntransfer and translations were sent via e-mail and there were many Excel\nspreadsheets to keep track of product launches and priorities. This resulted in\nunstructured processes and long lead times.\n\nWith HiFi Klubben’s Optimizely solution complemented by InRiver PIM for product\ndata management, product data routines have become more efficient. It’s quicker\nto set up new products in the e-shop, and particularly important launches can be\nprioritized. Contact with translators can now be managed directly in the system,\nand it’s also easy for suppliers to help enrich content.\n\nMore importantly, the focus on product data has significantly improved the\npurchasing experience. The customer is met by product descriptions that are\nconsiderably longer than usual and can access expert assessments of products, as\nwell as links to tests and accessories.\n\nWe have moved from unstructured to structured data that is searchable and\nfilterable, and it has become easier to edit products in bulk. In the long term,\nproduct data will create great value for us.\n\nKarsten Birkelund\n\nDirector, eCommerce & Omnichannel, HiFi Klubben\n\n## **About HiFi Klubben**\n\nHiFi Klubben is Europe’s largest specialist chain within high-quality sound,with\nmore than 95 physical stores in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Germany and the\nNetherlands, as well as five national online stores.

    "content": "# Marmon Link increases page views and unique visitors\n\nMarmon Link moves beyond a website to transformative experiences with Optimizely\nB2B Commerce Cloud\n\n## A new name and a sharpened focus on customers\n\nThey’ve got a new name but they’re just as focused (if not more) on their\ncustomers as they were when they were founded as 3Wire in 2001. Marmon Link is\nan industry leading foodservice and beverage replacement parts distributor.\nThey’re committed to providing the highest quality products and services to food\nand beverage customers coast-to-coast.\n\nMarmon Link offers the single biggest selection of replacement parts, technical\nsupport and customer service – for Marmon-branded equipment, supporting industry\nleading brands such as Cornelius, Prince Castle and Silver King. The company’s\ngenuine Marmon-branded OEM parts go through vigorous testing and extensive\nquality assurance. The team is highly efficient and works to ensure the highest\ncustomer satisfaction.\n\n## Rising up to the challenge and beating the competition\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in the food and beverage industry is that it‘s\ndifficult to anticipate order needs. While other industries have predictive\nmodels for replacement needs, Marmon Link customers do not always know when they\nwill need parts for their equipment. When the need arises, the need is\nimmediate. That means suppliers like Marmon Link must have the inventory\navailable and have the ability to deliver parts as soon as humanly possible.\n\nIn order to keep up with competition and meet customers’ immediate needs for\nreplacement parts, Marmon Link knew they had to completely transform the buying\nexperience. They needed to build a distinct digital advantage over their\ncompetition or they’d lose customers.\n\n## A marketing-led charge\n\nMarmon Link concluded they needed a complete revamp of their user experience to\nkeep up. Where to turn? Website, eCommerce and integration projects are often\nled by IT professionals or c-suite leaders. However, a different player stepped\nup to the plate for Marmon Link.\n\nWe’re seeing more and more eCommerce projects being led by strong marketing\nleaders, and Jennie Stenback, VP Marketing and eCommerce at Marmon Link was just\nthe person for the job.\n\nFrom the beginning, Stenback knew that this went far beyond a website. She\ncalled it a transformational initiative; allowing for the unique complexities\ninherent in B2B environments. And she knew it would require an entire company\nshift, not just a website.\n\nThe marketing-led transformation needed buy-in across the organization and with\ntheir customers. Cross-functional team development was critical. In Marmon\nLink’s case key players in eCommerce included marketing, project management, IT,\nERP strategists, business analysts, customer care, finance, logistics and sales.\nThey needed their frontline sales representatives and Customer Service\nRepresentatives on board to help interpret what their customers were demanding\nfrom their buying journeys.\n\n## From a turnkey solution to a scalable one\n\nThe base eCommerce platform Marmon Link originally had in place was rigid and\nnot customizable. Even more challenging, the original platform was blind to\nsearch engines on the most critical elements of parts inventory. Marmon Link\nneeded a technology that could scale and grow with the business and enabled them\nto build an enhanced and modern user experience – allowing for the unique\ncomplexities of B2B.\n\nThe Marmon Link team needed to find a solution that could accomplish the\nfollowing:\n\n- Service both businesses and individual customers\n- Out-of-the-box B2B functionality\n- Considerable customizability\n- Marriage between a B2B purchasing environment and a B2C-type frontend\n- Improve overall UX\n- Align with modernized processes and policies\n- Accommodate freight programming and simplified pricing models\n\nMarmon Link chose the Optimizely Configured Commerce because of its flexibility\nand robustness. Leveraging the platform, Marmon Link launched multiple websites,\neach serving complex customer needs. The websites manage integrated search\nengine results and flexible platform modifications for a vastly improved\ncustomer experience.\n\n## Transformational results\n\nAfter implementing Optimizely Configured Commerce, Marmon Link made immediate\nprogress toward ROI. They’re converting more users, gaining new customers and\nare a force to be reckoned with in the marketplace.\n\nMarmon Link has seen significant increases across the board, including seeing an\nincrease in page views and unique visitors.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.marmonlink.com/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nXNGAGE\n\nXNGAGE is a Digital Services firm focused on delivering Commerce Success in B2B\nfor leading manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers.",

    "content": "# Military Officers Association of America's 52% mobile traffic\n\nFrom a restrictive legacy platform to creating a more fulfilling engagement with\ntheir 355,000 members, MOAA share with us their member-centric journey so far.\n\nMOAA, Military Officer's Association have been around since 1929, advocating for\nmilitary officers and their families. They provide supplements for members\nincluding healthcare benefits and member enticements.\n\nQuickly creating and publishing vital content is a large part of the digital\nteam's mission as their membership spans the entire spectrum of military\nofficers from all walks.\n\n''We do have some users that are congressional leaders that use our information\nbecause it's so well written and it's so easy to understand''. Yumi Belanga,\nSenior Director of Digital Programs at MOAA mentions. Yumi goes on to mention\nthat their efforts are, ''as simple as just getting a news page up that we need\nto promote or sometimes it's a multi-month-wide campaign that we need to kind of\nmove along very, make changes as the campaign kind of progresses into its\nculmination during the month''.\n\nHaving to pivot and react to various legislation, news and guidance it was\nimportant that the MOAA team upgraded their aging content management system from\nEktron, to an enterprise-grade CMS that would seamlessly scale alongside their\norganization. MOAA felt Ektron restricted their ability to create new content\npieces in a quick fashion and limited their reach to new, potential audiences.\n\n''We were on Ektron before, which served us well for a good time being. But we\nwanted to really think about how we can meet our members and our potential\nmembers or prospects in a better way online, digitally'', comments Yumi. ''So we\nknew that the DXC platform had a lot of great features that could get us there.\n\nQuote Block (New): New Block\n\n## Digital tools that make it easier\n\n''We're becoming smarter about how to promote ourselves and to get information\nout the way that we think it would resonate best with users'', Yumi says when\nasked about the benefits MOAA enjoy since migrating to Optimizely Digital\nExperience Platform.\n\nOther benefits MOAA are experiencing include;\n\n- Better flexibility\n- The ease of learning\n- Scalability\n- Stronger reliability\n\nOptimizely Content Cloud is built on Microsoft Azure, meaning MOAA is always\ncompliant with the latest security regulations they are obliged to meet. It also\nmeans their site can handle spikes in traffic, without downtime. Utilizing\nOptimizely, MOAA's site is used in a more dynamic format, using to it to build\nawareness, their offering and appealing to even more potential members.\n\n''We've seen a lot more of our users staying on being more engaged. Whether it's\nstaying on a page longer, which is always a goal for us because again, our page\nis very content heavy. We don't want them to just pop off and search for\nsomething else using a main search. I think they're [users] coming around to it\nand seeing us more as a resource and because of the way that we can display\ninformation'', Yumi tells us.\n\n## Learning the digital journey\n\nWhen it comes to the mobile site, Yumi shares that MOAA is ''more cognizant now\nof all of the content and information that we put [publish], to make sure that\nthe mobile experience is ideal. Maybe we don't need to be as wordy in some\ncontent''.\n\nThese types of learnings are leading to outcome benefits that MOAA members have\nnot seen or expected. As their content delivery evolves, so too does their\nengagement. Optimizely Content Cloud is built for speed, and MOAA editors can\nquickly deliver information to its membership community of hundreds-of-\nthousands, with an agile digital team of 10 people.\n\n## A diverse, mobile community\n\nOptimizely Content Cloud have enabled MOAA to be more inclusive to their growing\ncommunity. Yumi explains that they've built ''a micro-site semi-dedicated to\nmental wellbeing and general wellbeing. But we do make sure that we consider all\nof these, we do try to be inclusive with all of our various types of content and\nhow we display it and how we execute it''.\n\nMobile is having a massive impact to their work. It's not only the younger\ngenerations who desire content delivered on-the-go, charting the shift in\ndigital expectations. Yumi explains MOAA ''saw that mobile overtook desktop,\nwhich is huge for us because our user base is from probably age of 18 to the age\nof 108 so we have a wide age range and most of our demographics is probably\nclose to around the 60 to 70 age range''. Deploying Optimizely, MOAA is better\nequipped to meet growing expectations from their user-base.\n\n#### Industry\n\nTech\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.moaa.org/",

Providing convenient access to critical industry content needed\nto support better treatment decisions and patient outcomes, they an active reach\nof over a million healthcare professionals globally.\n\nThe organisation supports two customer groups: the healthcare professionals that\nuse their website to access clinical information, and the pharmaceutical\ncompanies that fund educational content on the platform.\n\nThe brunt of the information on the website revolves around raising awareness\nabout diseases, treatment pathways, and other related drugs. Their aim is to\nincrease each individual healthcare professional's awareness and understanding\nof a certain disease within their given specialty – for example, stroke\nprevention.\n\n''It's about increasing a healthcare professional's awareness and understanding\nof a certain disease or treatment approach…to do that effectively in an\ninformation saturated, crowded content marketplace, we need to make that content\ndiscoverable, and easy to consume in a timely fashion'', comments Selena Smith-\nTaylor, Digital Project Manager at EPG Health, on the service EPG Health’s\nMedthority website (www.medthority.com) provides.\n\n**Creating an indulgent content strategy for a time-poor audience**\n\nSelena’s team leads EPG Health’s continuous improvement group. They experiment,\niterate and optimise content and drive the adoption of a test and learn culture,\nwhich enables EPG Health to optimise its digital content and create first-class\ndigital experiences. As Selena explains, the key to successfully promoting their\ncontent through Optimizely’s CMS is about delivering relevance and targeted\ncontent to its users.\n\nBy driving the right audience to the most important educational material, and\nmeasuring their engagement, EPG Health can confidently provide insight to\nclients regarding how well their key messages have landed amongst their target\naudience, and the likelihood of resultant behaviour change.\n\nContent consumers cover a range of healthcare professionals all of whom can\nregister with their chosen speciality as well as identify areas of interest, so\nthey are kept abreast of industry news. Visitors include:\n\n- Specialists\n- General Medicine Professionals\n- GPs\n- Nurses\n- Students\n\nSelena comments, ''given we know, through our extensive market research, that\nHealthcare Professionals are generally ‘time-poor’, and there is an ocean of\ncontent to swim-through, we need to do the hard-work for them, by quickly\npresenting them with updates in their areas of interest….for example, if a\nCardiologist is on Medthority [an EPG Health website], the platform will\nintuitively promote content ‘suggestions within their Specialty area’, or ‘your\npeers are looking at’ style recommendations”.\n\nEPG Health’s customers expect robust well architected digital solutions that\nleverage the best in digital experience and marketing toolsets. Its web users\nare time poor healthcare professionals, and expect inspiring, reliable, safe and\nefficient digital experiences. Given the competition for time in a Healthcare\nProfessional’s busy day, Selena’s team are constantly analysing what really\nmatters to foster engagement, which means adopting a ‘digital publishing\nmindset’, within a typically traditional academic space.\n\n## **EPG Health select Optimizely over competitors**\n\nBefore Optimizely, EPG Health’s development team were often developing or\nbuilding functionality that replicated off-the-shelf tools. Because of this\ntactic, there was a perception internally that things often took too long, were\nrarely comparable to off-the-shelf products and were overly complex and\nvulnerable. EPG Health had developed their own web environment using CFML based\ncoding principals in a CMS configuration based on a 3rd party proprietary\nconfiguration, with backend databases linked to 3rd party e-mail marketing\ntools.\n\nEPG Health needed an extensible solution that allowed them to quickly adapt\ntheir web offering to the demands of their customers and web users. Prior to\nselecting Optimizely as a technology partner and ultimately leveraging the in-\nhouse Optimizely Expert Services team, EPG Health considered many CMS providers.\nOptimizely was ultimately chosen by the EPG Health team due to the internal\nperception of inherent solution extensibility and focus on personalisation\nfeatures and intelligent search, with the (Optimizely) solution mix containing\nbetter integrated solutions for re-marketing and potential solutions aligned to\nEPG Health’s product roadmap.\n\n## **Influencing and changing a health care professional's way of working**\n\nEPG Health launched its Medthority website in April 2020 on Optimizely’s\ncustomer-centric Digital Experience Platform utilizing:\n\n- Optimizely Content Management System (CMS) with Search & Navigation\n- Marketing Automation\n- Content Recommendations.\n\nUsing registered profiles through Optimizely **Visitor Intelligence** helps\nlearn what visitors are doing on the site and provides clever suggestions of\nrelevant content based upon their profile and/or their behaviour.

Testing, iterating, and optimizing ad viewability is the way today’s\nmost successful publishers are working toward that goal.\n\n> It’s essential for any publisher to care about viewability and pay attention\n> to this metric.\n> — A.R. Tabrizi, Optimization Manager, Demand Media\n> Ad viewability is the concept of how visible ads on a website or mobile app are\n> to users. This key metric can make or break the amount of ad revenue a publisher\n> brings in. Optimizing ad viewability can help publishers increase the value of\n> their display inventory and maximize ad revenue.\n\n### Optimizely's Moat Integration\n\neHow uses Optimizely’s Moat integration ensure high viewability rates for their\nads. Using the integration, the eHow team builds A/B tests where they experiment\nwith different page layouts and designs, tracking the impact each change has on\nad views to ensure the highest levels of viewability, performance, and ROI for\ndigital ad campaigns and content.\n\nThe following example is a test eHow recently ran to improve ad viewability on\nits website.\n\n## eHow’s banner visibility test\n\neHow was experiencing low viewability metrics for the banner ads on it's “how-\nto” content pages. To drive these metrics back in the right direction, the eHow\nteam experimented with a sticky banner ad, which would stay visible on a\nreader’s screen until they scrolled to a certain depth on each page. They\nhypothesised that making the banner sticky would keep it in view for a longer\nperiod of time, thus improving its visibility. They tracked a variety of\nmetrics, including ad viewability, reader scroll depth, and engagement.\n\neHow experimented with a sticky banner ad, which would stay visible on a\nreader's screen until they scrolled to a certain depth on each page.\n\nAs the results came in, eHow was met with another challenge. While the sticky\nbanner did improve ad viewability metrics, there were also negative side\neffects. It seemed that the sticky banner performed well in the eyes of\nadvertisers, but not readers – scroll depth and engagement with related content,\nand pageviews plummeted.\n\neHow used this information to iterate, testing a second option. In this\niteration, they still opted for the sticky banner, but controlled its display\nbased on time, rather than scroll depth. After a reader had been on the page for\na certain amount of time, the sticky banner would disappear. They hypothesized\nthat this option would better meet the needs of both advertisers and readers.\nThe idea being that the ad would disappear more quickly in this case (as soon as\nit met the appropriate attention requirements), giving readers a undisrupted\nexperience earlier on, while their interest in the article was still piqued.\n\n### Results\n\nThe results for the iterated variation of the sticky banner were overwhelmingly\npositive, greatly improving ad viewability metrics without disrupting\nengagement, scroll depth, or pageviews. These results helped inform changes made\nacross eHow’s content pages. eHow was able to use higher viewability metrics to\nincrease the value of its display inventory to advertisers. The end result?\nSignificant gains in ad revenue for eHow, better viewability for its\nadvertisers, and a high-quality experience for readers.\n\nThe combination of Optimizely and Moat allowed us to quickly launch and iterate\non ideas, with the ability to have shorter development cycles. It also helped us\nget a full picture of the website performance and user behavior.\n\nA.R.

But in\n1979, small bottles of soaps, shampoos, conditioners and other toiletries\nweren’t always available in hotels. That’s why Guest Supply was founded.\n\nFrom humble roots as a one man supplier out of a garage, to a global thought-\nleader and innovator in the hospitality space, Guest Worldwide serves more than\n25,000 customers in over 120 countries. Guest Worldwide is built on a deeply-\nrooted philosophy that customer service is the unquestioned catalyst for raising\nthe bar on quality, innovation and efficacy.\n\nThe global collective is comprised of three companies including textile\nmanufacturer, Manchester Mills, personal care amenities manufacturer, Gilchrist\n& Soames and hospitality distributor, Guest Supply.\n\nThe hospitality arm of Guest Worldwide, Guest Supply needed a digital overhaul\nwhich is where Optimizely came in.\n\n## Trail blazing as an early adopter of ecommerce\n\nAs an innovator and digital leader in their industry, Guest Supply was an early\nadopter of ecommerce. In the early 90s, an internal development team at Guest\nSupply engineered a homegrown ecommerce system.\n\nAt the time, the system was cutting edge and steps ahead of Guest Supply’s top\ncompetitors. However, Guest Supply eventually outgrew the system and recognized\nthat their solution which was once the pinnacle of the industry, needed to be\nupdated.\n\nThe overall experience of the site was outdated, search functionality was\nlikened to an automated excel spreadsheet and navigation was not intuitive. The\ndigital team at Guest Supply, led by Kristin Richards, Director of eCommerce,\nknew it was time for a massive overhaul.\n\nWhile Guest Supply was once blazing the digital trails, competitors mimicked\nthem and eventually caught up on digital, offering seamless experiences and\nsimple ways to buy online. Guest Supply was losing customers to competitors and\nneeded to modernize their experience to separate themselves from the pack.\n\nGuest Supply is a very complex business. We needed a solution that took those\ncomplex business rules into account and solved for them. Optimizely B2B Commerce\nCloud solves even our most complex challenges with ease.\n\nKristin Richards\n\nDirector eCommerce, Guest Worldwide\n\n## Award Winner: Best B2B Buying Experience\n\nThis award is presented to the Optimizely customer who creates B2B digital\nexperiences that best combine an engaging buying and self-service experience,\nwith rich content relevant to the B2B personas they serve.\n\n## Solving complex business challenges\n\nAfter recognizing the need for a change, Guest Supply began weighing their\noptions. They needed to determine whether they would build another system\ninternally, or partner with a technology provider that offered a system off-the-\nshelf.\n\nThe field sales organization at Guest Supply is comprised of more than 250\npeople throughout the country. Sales representatives consistently provided\nfeedback that with the old system, they could not do their jobs efficiently\nbecause they were too busy doing administrative work. They did not have a\nplatform that enabled customers to self-serve. Instead salespeople were\nresponsible for entering orders, tracking information and providing order\nupdates to customers.\n\nGuest Supply wanted to build a robust system that made it possible to carry out\nany interaction through the website. The transformation was never about\neliminating their sales team. Instead, it would extend the sales team and give\nthem the opportunity to focus on higher-value activities.\n\nThe homegrown platform provided Guest Supply with little to no marketing\ncapabilities. Because the ordering functionality lived behind a separate site,\nGuest Supply could not carry out email marketing, create landing pages or\ndevelop other promotions that would lead directly to a customer transaction.\n\nFinally, Guest Supply had little to no control over the content on the site\nbecause the system did not have a built-in CMS. The website was completely\nstatic and required developers any time even a simple change was requested,\nwhich was highly inefficient.\n\nWhen hunting for the proper ecommerce system, Guest Supply’s list of\nrequirements included:\n\n- Robust CMS\n- Globalization\n- Personalization\n- Quick order\n- Intuitive navigation\n- Modern experience\n- Responsive\n- Mobile app\n- Scalability\n- Flexibility\n\nGuest Supply is a large company with a very diverse customer base ranging from\nsome of the biggest hotel brands in the world to independent properties. All\ncustomers have very unique needs and the platform would need to enable Guest\nSupply to serve a large range of customer needs.\n\n## More than a website\n\nWith ecommerce, Guest Supply intended to extend their sales team, not replace\nthem. The entire digital transformation was about prioritizing customers, while\nenabling their sales force to do what they do best – focus on selling.\n\nTo meet and beat Amazon, Wayfair and others, Guest Supply wanted to deliver a\nseamless online experience, while also offering a team of experts that customers\ncould talk to if they’d rather do that. The key was to deliver the best of both\nworlds. Wayfair and Amazon can’t compete with the expertise and service Guest\nSupply offers.\n\nFor Guest Supply, partnering with Optimizely was about far more than overhauling\ntheir digital properties and deploying a new website. It was a cultural change,\na paradigm shift. It was complete digital and business transformation that\nchanged everything from finance to procurement to marketing and beyond.\n\nGuest Supply has a digital roadmap in place to continue making improvements to\ntheir digital offering. It is not a project they will set and",

    "content": "# How Star Tribune increased digital subscription volume by 35%\n\n## One publisher continues to make headlines by overcoming challenges with\n\nexperimentation\n\nAfter a century and a half of reporting the news that matters most to Minnesota,\nthe Star Tribune looked to extend its digital reach in an all-too-competitive\nmarketplace. By embracing Optimizely and its robust experimentation platform,\nStar Tribune grew its digital subscriber base and found a better balance of\nconsumer and advertising revenue.\n\n## Going digital wasn't enough\n\nStar Tribune was the first major-metropolitan news organization after the New\nYork Times to launch a digital subscription product. And while the initial\nresults looked promising, sales slowed in 2015 despite efforts to redesign their\nsite and improve their digital channel marketing. Business was plateauing.\n\nJust a year earlier, Johnston had joined the team. He noticed that there was\nample data to assist decision making, but no experimentation methodology in\nplace to help understand the data’s practical impact on business functions. It\nwas clear that the organization could benefit from a holistic way to measure the\nincremental impacts of various changes they were making to their digital\njournalism and advertising products, particularly when factoring in seasonal\nswings and the constantly changing news cycle.\n\nPerhaps the most pressing challenge they faced was how they could best optimize\nsite revenue. Their metered paywall approach allowed them to keep site traffic\nrobust in order to sell ample advertising. But by asking more visitors to become\nsubscribers, they could increase circulation revenue. Somewhere in between was\nthe answer.\n\n## Testing the hypothesis\n\nJohnston’s belief was that StarTribune.com could achieve optimal revenue by\nlowering the number of free articles that viewers could access before being\nasked to subscribe. Increasing subscription revenue, he hypothesized, could\noffset any decrease in engagement that affected ad revenue.\n\nUsing Optimizely X Web Personalization, Johnston’s team experimented with three\ntest variations. The first and current offer included 10 free articles before\nreaders were required to subscribe. The second permitted access to 7 free\narticles. The final version offered 5 free articles.\n\nThey assumed the 5-article experiment would drive the highest subscription rate\nbecause it interrupted readers earlier. What they discovered surprised them.\n\n## Exceeding expectations\n\n5-article variation outperformed 10-article with a 49% lift in subscription\nrevenue, and a -12% decrease in ad revenue, leading to a +15% lift in overall\nrevenue. However, the 7-article offer had a +37% subscription revenue lift, but\nhalf of the decrease in ad revenue (-6%), leading to +20% lift in overall\nrevenue against the 10-article variation.\n\nWithout experimenting, Johnston admits, they likely would have proceeded with\nthe 5-article offer and taken the hit on ad revenue, missing the opportunity to\nlearn what actually works best. Being able to account for changes in both\nsubscription rates and ad engagement also renewed the team’s interest in\nconducting additional tests on functions such as personalized article\nrecommendations and newsletter acquisition in order to drive customer\nengagement. Ultimately, the team was able to increase subscriptions by 35% year\nover year.\n\n## A total transformation\n\nJohnston now believes that experimentation has completely transformed his\norganization. _“We've gone from sitting around a table debating hunches and\nopinions,”_ he confesses, _“to trying things out on a small percentage of our\ntraffic with open minds and eager anticipation.”_\n\nHe also has this message for those just dipping their toes into the\nexperimentation world—don’t be timid. _“The idea of subjecting your site to a\nnew platform, experimentation, and personalization can all be pretty\nintimidating,”_ Johnston points out, noting that, _“Once you start, you realize\nit's not so scary and it actually mitigates the risk of making changes.”_\n\nPerhaps the most compelling observation Johnston made was this: experimentation\nchanges people. They begin to think differently, feel more involved, see the\nimpact of their ideas, and with that comes a tremendous amount of satisfaction.\n\n## Just Getting Started\n\nWith site revenue up, Johnston’s team now wants to focus on nurturing customer\nrelationships. Naturally, they plan to improve the way they move non-subscribers\nthrough the conversion funnel, but they also want to understand customer\npreferences and be able to personalize each customer’s experience.\n\n_“I firmly believe that gaining the ability to quickly make changes, see the\nimpacts, and then move on to the next idea was essential to our success this\npast year.\" — Patrick Johnston_\n\nThanks to Optimizely, Johnston is confident they can add value at each stage of\ntheir journey.\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.startribune.com/",

However, the system presented a number of challenges,\nlimiting their ability to manage and deliver an experience that met customers’\ndemands.\n\nWhile leveraging their original system, DSG saw less than .2 percent online\nsales. They knew there was an untapped opportunity where digital was concerned,\nso they set out to grow online sales to 10 percent over the course of three\nyears.\n\nWith aggressive goals to grow online sales and improve their customer\nexperience, DSG began their hunt for the right technology provider.\n\n## Deep B2B capabilities were top of mind when selecting a new platform\n\nDSG knew they couldn’t just put a bandage on their digital experience. They\nneeded to overhaul the experience with a system that was built for distribution,\nfrom the ground up.\n\nDSG was looking for a platform with an intuitive interface that could grant them\ncontrol of the experience across their highly segmented business.\n\nOther digital requirements included the ability to run targeted promotions and\npersonalize by segments, customer-specific pricing, sophisticated search\ncapabilities and the ability to handle tens of thousands of product SKUs and\ntheir relevant product information.\n\nFor DSG, mastering product content was also paramount to building a seamless\ncustomer experience. DSG sources their product data from multiple sources\nincluding the Industry Data Warehouse and AD and partners with Bravo Media and\nDDS. They needed to build out content their customers could trust and feed the\ndata into the ecommerce engine.\n\nDSG eventually decided to partner with Optimizely and leverage Optimizely B2B\nCommerce Cloud because the platform met many of their requirements right out of\nthe box. DSG also leverages Optimizely Mobile and B2B Commerce Analytics to\npower their digital experience.\n\nAt DSG, there’s nothing more important right now than digital acceleration. It’s\nall about improving the customer experience. We want it to be faster, simpler\nand easier for our customers to interact with DSG. With Optimizely, all of that\nis possible\n\nTodd Sisson\n\nEcommerce Manager, Dakota Supply Group\n\n## Driving internal and external adoption\n\nThe entire DSG team bought into the new ecommerce platform early on. They\nbrought the sales and marketing organizations onboard and showcased the business\nvalue of ecommerce. To promote internal adoption and buy-in, DSG leverages\ntactics like:\n\n- Weekly digital “Did You Know” communications\n- Weekly digital analytics updates that highlight successes and opportunities\n- Digital adoption reports\n- Regular sales team adoption performance updates\n\nWith B2B Commerce Cloud, DSG is able to free up their sales team to complete\nhigher value tasks, while enabling their customers to self-serve. It’s a win-\nwin.\n\nDSG built a system with the customer top of mind. DSG never intended to force\ntheir customers to buy online. Instead, they focused on making business faster,\nsimpler and easier through digital self-service.\n\n## Optimizing digital self-service\n\nToday, more than ever, customers want to serve themselves online, sometimes\nwithout ever interacting with a salesperson. DSG has a robust strategy to\noptimize digital self-service through features of the B2B Commerce Cloud\nplatform. Some of the features DSG focuses on most are:\n\n- **List Management** – DSG’s sales team creates lists of products and shares them with customers to create higher value and ease of purchase.\n- **Account Management** – Customers are able to view stages of orders, upload orders, manage lists, and review order history. DSG is committed to continuous improvement. They are focused on making enhancements to invoice and order search, which has helped speed up the process of finding an invoice or order.\n- **Billpay Integration** – In March 2020, DSG began the process of integrating Billpay so customers could pay their bills online. The integration drove a lot of activity to the website and DSG saw a 30 percent increase in registrations for an online account after announcing the feature.\n- **B2B Commerce Search** – Search has been absolutely crucial to the user experience at DSG. To optimize search, DSG dissects zero results and identifies synonyms or misspellings they can fix. In addition, they continuously improve keywords and combined words. They boost historical purchases and build customer group personas. The focus on enhancing search has yielded a four times conversion rate increase, three times revenue per session increase, five times session time increase and five times pageviews increase. In 2020, customers spent more than 12,500 hours online with DSG.\n- **Product Recommendations\\*\\***–\\*\\* DSG leverages Optimizely Product Recommendations with B2B Commerce Cloud to deliver a personalized buying experience for their customers.

DSG runs product recommendations on pages including brand detail, home, cart, my list, order confirmation, search results and others. In just 30 days, 2.84 percent of DSG’s online orders were influenced by product recommendations.

DSG tracks digitally engaged customers\nthrough a dashboard in B2B Commerce Analytics.\n\nDSG has been analyzing digitally engaged customers and the value they have on\nthe business. They’ve found that digitally engaged customers:\n\n- Place 4 times more orders than a non-digitally engaged customer\n- Buy 25% more line items on each order\n- Have an average order value 4 times higher than a non-digitally engaged customer\n\nThus far, 30 percent of DSG’s customers have registered for an account on\ndsgsupply.com. 25 percent have logged on to the website and 20 percent have\nbenefitted from a digital self-service event.\n\n## The future is bright\n\nLooking ahead, DSG has aggressive goals to increase digitally engaged customers,\npromote digital self-service, incorporate product recommendations and grow the\nbusiness overall.\n\nWith robust product recommendations and personalization capabilities, DSG aims\nto increase lines per order, improve conversion rates, present products faster,\nincrease engagement and grow revenue.\n\nDSG is accelerating their digital roadmap and recognizes how important digital\nbusiness is for DSG’s future. In 2021, they plan to focus on customer managed\npart numbers, build ship to features, incorporate chat and launch customer\nrecommendations. By 2022, they plan to build out a project estimator, product\ncalculators, SMS order tracking and other customer tools.\n\nPrior to implementing Optimizely’s solutions, DSG saw less than .2% of business\nbeing conducted online. In early stages with Optimizely, they’ve seen that\npercentage increase 13 times. Optimizely is proud to be DSG’s partner in digital\ntransformation.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.dsgsupply.com/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nXNGAGE\n\nXNGAGE is a Digital Services firm focused on delivering Commerce Success in B2B\nfor leading manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers.",

These include modular systems, fibre cement and\nplasterboard systems, applications for cladding, façade, roofing and terrace,\nhigh-performance fire protection and insulation for construction and OEM\napplications. The business operates from more than 160 facilities across 45\ncountries and employs over 13,500 personnel. With revenue of €3.8 billion in\n2023, Etex is among the 10 largest Belgium-based companies by revenue.\n\n**A focus on collaboration, sharing and ease of use**\n\nEtex runs 33 different brands and websites. As Digital Product Manager (Web and\nPortal) Arne Rotty explained, the company migrated to Optimizely from a Sitecore\nlegacy system that could not deliver the level of dynamic sharing and cross-\nsystem integrations that Etex strove to achieve.\n\nSpecifically, Etex approached Optimizely with a view to implementing a system of\ntechnologies that would allow their marketers to provide customers and prospects\nwith personalized information and content– to be able to “communicate the right\nmessaging to the right people, at the right time.” Furthermore, Etex is a\ncorporation built on sharing, so marketing teams worldwide needed a centralized\nplatform to share insights, expertise, and feedback.\n\nOn top of this functionality, Etex leadership were seeking a solution that would\nbe easy-to-use, avoiding a complex architecture. Leadership wanted any potential\nsolution to be simple for marketers to use to ensure that they had exactly what\nthey needed to immediately create and distribute content, without having to\ncompromise time by reading an instruction manual. Etex also craved a platform\nthat would speak directly to a new breed of customer as the profile of a\n‘typical’ buyer was shifting.**Working together across multiple websites and\ngeographies**\n\nEtex worked alongside long-term partner Delaware to find the best Content\nManagement System (CMS) solution, and soon concluded that Optimizely provided a\nbetter solution than the incumbent Sitecore, or other shortlisted providers such\nas Adobe.\n\nOptimizely’s CMS met all Etex’s requirements. Using Optimizely, Etex marketers\nquickly realized that they could develop and work with content in a way that\nhelped them establish and nurture relationships with their end users, while\npreviously, Etex’s relationship strategy had been limited to contractors.\n\nAs Arne Rotty explained, Optimizely’s CMS provides a host of benefits that were\nabsent from the legacy system. These include enhanced scalability, a shared\ncomponent base and a single backend for 33 different websites. Rotty also noted\nthat Optimizely’s pricing was more competitive and there were additional add-ons\nthat had not been available previously.\n\nEase of use was also a critically important factor for Etex’s internal teams.\nRotty remarked that Optimizely’s CMS “works fluently from a content creator\npoint of view. It is easy and intuitive to navigate and create content. Also,\nthe ‘shared’ content folder makes its very easy to reuse content.”\n\nOnce the new system was in place, downtime became a thing of the past. Rotty\ndetailed that “the fact that the CMS is hosted as a SaaS solution enables our\nmarketing personnel to work on their content worldwide without any performance\ndrops.”\n\nCross collaboration is also core to Etex’s needs. By using the projects\nfunctionality, a large number of people can work on the platform simultaneously.\nIn this case, that equates to 550 people at a time creating web content across\n33 sites in more than 70 languages.\n\nOptimizely’s CMS works fluently from a content creator point of view. It is easy\nand intuitive to navigate and create content. Also, the ‘shared’ content folder\nmakes its very easy to reuse content.\n\nArne Rotty\n\nDigital Product Manager (Web and Portal)\n\n**Use of ODP and other integrations**\n\nEtex uses Optimizely Data Platform (ODP) to store customer related data. ODP can\nunify customer data, from every source, connecting at a single click to LinkedIn\nLead Gen Ads, HubSpot, Salesforce CRM, and other platforms.\n\nIt can be used to build, deploy, and maintain custom integrations quickly and\neffectively. ODP then uses unified data to deliver comprehensive customer\nprofiles, track behaviours, create segments, and activate through downstream\nchannels.\n\nThe Optimizely CMS has also been integrated with multiple other platforms across\nthe Etex network, including Inriver, Digizuite, SAP, Litmos, Metalocator,\nOnetrust and Lionbridge.**Building a content legacy**\n\nContent is king, and central to how Etex establishes touchpoints with their\ncommunity, and how they build business relationships. To ensure that every piece\nof their content always meets its full potential and reaches every relevant\nperson throughout varying customer journeys, Etex needed to integrate their CMS\nwith a digital asset management (DAM) solution.\n\nAs Etex conducted their search for a new DAM solution – one that would maximize\ntheir experience with Optimizely – they reiterated their requirements for\ndigital solutions: a platform that would allow users to provide personalized\nend-to-end customer experiences, and one that would also be easy to use.\n\nDigizuite",

Rotty acknowledged that\nthey approached the project with some trepidation, but they decided to proceed\nin January 2024 due to the numerous benefits of upgrading to CMS 12. The\nmigration is almost complete. He said: “We knew that by postponing, we would\nmiss out on future upgrades, and it would be a black cloud that kept on\nfollowing us. So ultimately, we decided to fully commit and get it done as fast\nas possible.”\n\nCMS12 brings significant benefits. Faster page loads equate to lower bounce\nrates and increased site engagement, contributing to higher customer\nsatisfaction and revenue. The upgrade delivers 4x better response time and 5-10x\nfaster user experiences for actions like Register/Login, Search, and Add to\nCart. It also has three times more server request handling capability. It also\nbrings increased search ranking and SEO scores based on Google Core Web Vitals.\n\nFurthermore, there are new features and UX benefits that are only available with\nCMS12. These enable digital marketers and content editors to take advantage of\nfaster and more efficient content authoring and an enhanced editing experience,\nwith a new dashboard experience, in-line block editing, the ability to work with\na page in different view modes and many other features.\n\nAs it stands now, one thing is for sure: the story of Etex’s implementation of\neach element of its new-and-improved marketing stack has been a successful one.\nThe deep-running theme of this story is end-to-end collaboration, which is all\ntoo appropriate for Etex, a company that considers collaboration invaluable.\nOptimizely is proud to be part of this collaborative effort.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Content Management System\n- Recommendations\n- Data Platform\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\ndelaware\n\nWe are an entity with 250+ consultants, we continuously invests in improving\ncustomer engagement and omnichannel competences.",

This included consolidating\nand integrating the content from six separate CMS sites into a single instance.\nDue to a fixed go-live date, Altius needed the project to be completed within a\ntight timeframe, including obtaining feedback and agreement across the various\nbusiness units and stakeholders.\n\nThe approach was to focus on a simple and clean templated framework to ensure\ncontent was easy to edit, authorise and publish across various channels.

HYG designs,\nengineers, manufactures, sells and services a comprehensive line of lift trucks\nand aftermarket parts. These are primarily marketed under the Hyster® and Yale®\nbrand names. The business covers hundreds of end-user applications in more than\n770 industries.\n\nHYG wanted to create a more meaningful relationship with its customers,\nprospects, partners and dealers in a digital-first world and make it easier to\ndo business with them. Product innovations within the area of lift trucks, such\nas IOT, robotics and automation, increase the complexity of HYG’s offerings,\naccelerating the need to move the offering from just the physical product (the\nlift truck) to more value-added solutions. With the market becoming more\ncompetitive in the solution-oriented area, HYG needed to reimagine its digital\nexperiences to be able to communicate a more complex value offering and create a\ndigitized buying journey for its customers.\n\nHYG chose Optimizely’s customer success team to help refine and enhance the\nidentity of the Hyster and Yale global brands in a Digital First world and\nleverage a common technology platform from which to build the two sites. This\nwould enable the company to recognize customer journeys across the two brands\nbut also distinguish them enough for clarity of which brand is more appropriate\nin which scenarios.\n\nOptimizely began the engagement with an in-depth, ‘outside-in’ study of the two\nbrands, harnessing insights from surveys and interviews to assess the market’s\nperception of their relative positioning.\n\nThis was complemented through a digital insights exercise that was able to\nassess the actual positioning according to the websites’ current messaging and\nsemantics utilized. Understanding this positioning gap, while also assessing the\ncompetitive positioning outside of the two HYG brands, empowered Vertic to\ncreate a ‘Brand Eye’ strategy that defined the differentiation points and what\nthey inferred for digital brands interpretation.\n\nOptimizely’s extensive research continued to recognize subsequent content and\nfunctionality requirements at each stage of each brand’s customer buying\njourney, enabling HYG to recognize relevant aspects of the website build that\ncould scale across the two brands while building out the content strategy.\nTogether with the ‘Brand Eye’, this led to recommendations of new content or\nchanges in content that aligned with each brand’s audience’s expectations of\nmore solution-oriented information.\n\nThe UX and design of the two websites included the creation of a design system,\nwhich would enable scale of the web build by combining modules for the two\ncompanies’ web properties, with recommendations of cross-brand usage according\nto matching steps and need in the customer experience.\n\nOptimizely’s Digital Experience Platform was used to create the two separate\nsites, Hyster.com and Yale.com which were built to scale with dynamic\ncustomisation, brand touchpoint and profile information and much better\nreflected the brands evolution.\n\nCheck out www.hyster.com and www.yale.com to see the results\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.hyster-yale.com/",

For marketers, this means that the visual adaptation of newsletters\nto all relevant mobile devices is essential. TUI was also faced with the\nchallenge of making its email marketing fit for mobile use.\n\n## The solution: Responsive email design\n\nWith Mobile Fusion, TUI opted for Optimizely Campaign's mobile email\noptimization. This feature enables the tourism company to present its emails in\na visually convincing way on desktop devices, smartphones and tablets from a\nsingle source. Handling is simple and flexible on a template basis. The existing\nemail content is designed by the system for the various mobile devices. For\nresponsive e-mail designs, the end devices used by the recipients are\nautomatically recognized and the layouts are adapted to the screen size and\nresolution. TUI uses this service to send marketing and campaign emails as well\nas transactional emails.\n\n## Mobile handling of travel information\n\nIn response to increasing mobile internet usage, TUI has also optimized email\ncommunication for the \"My TUI\" service portal for smartphones and tablets. With\nthis portal, customers can handle the further handling of their trips completely\ndigitally after booking at the travel agency. A special function comes into play\nhere, which enables dynamic PDF attachments to be sent.

The charity saves lives and supports people before\nand after disaster strikes and works to alleviate suffering during wars and\nconflict. Australian Red Cross focuses on humanitarian aid and community\nservices for local communities in Australia and the Asia Pacific.\n\nPrior to implementing Optimizely, the Australian Red Cross faced challenges in\noptimizing their digital content, streamlining online transactions, and\nleveraging user data effectively.\n\nTraditionally, Australian Red Cross generated 98% of its shopping revenue from\n180 bricks-and-mortar shops selling pre-loved items. COVID lockdown arrived at\nthe start of the discovery phase, which changed the course of what Australian\nRed Cross needed to achieve. With lockdown and social distancing restrictions,\nit became clear that making an online premier destination for the shopper was\nmore important than ever. They needed to create a bespoke e-commerce platform,\nlaunched in time for Christmas.\n\nBeyond the urgent need for adaptation, the organization required an overall\ndigital transformation - and wanted to transition from an on-premise CMS\n(Kentico) to a cloud-based system. They recognized the need to create an overall\nimproved digital instance to better communicate and engage with present and\nfuture generations. Their initial focus was on fundraising, a crucial aspect for\nsupporting various programs.\n\nAdditional challenges included integrating diverse web platforms such as Web,\nCMS, marketing automation, personalization engines, and CRM integrations, From\nthe data side, the charity also needed to address siloed donor data and outdated\ndata architecture, and manual handling of supporter communications causing\ninefficiencies and privacy risks.\n\n## Solution\n\nTo help define the best solution for both the stakeholders and the staff at the\nRed Cross, Optimizely and the client’s preferred Optimizely partner LEVO went on\na discovery mission to define and point the extended Australian Red Cross family\nin the right direction through a series of workshops aligning priorities for the\norganization.\n\nTheir initial project goals were to enhance the commerce experience for users,\ncreate, manage, and optimize digital content seamlessly across multiple web\nproperties, and harness user data to personalize engagement.\n\nThe platform of choice was Optimizely One – including Customized Commerce,\ndescribed by the Australian Red Cross as a ''4-in-1'' e-commerce platform.\nOptimizely Customized Commerce enabled the charitable organization to better\nunderstand monetary contributions from visitors that span across, donations,\nretail purchases and other payment transfers. Australian Red Cross implemented\none instance to easily manage this aspect of operations and their content with\nOptimizely's best-in-class CMS capabilities.\n\nWith the support and experience of LEVO, Australian Red Cross streamlined 4\nseparate e-commerce platforms into one, central platform. The Optimizely\nCustomized Commerce enabled for intuitive purchasing experiences that\nintelligently guides the visitor. Australian Red Cross further embraced being at\nthe forefront of digital change by adopting other standout features including\nProduct Recommendations. The advent of AI, plus the new capability of selling\ndigitally demonstrates the appetite, shift, and ambition of Australia Red Cross\nto future-proof their commitment to its community.\n\nThe charity recognized it was essential to see and understand how a single\nstakeholder may have several different identities (for example, volunteer,\nshopper, donor) when interacting digitally with the Red Cross. The team created\nMyRedCross, a central unified platform for all stakeholders that meets the\ndigital requirements of today’s and future generations of digital users.\nMyRedCross was built to provide customers with a single portal to interact with\nthe website, and provide the charity’s employees with a 360-degree view of the\ncustomer on how they interact with the website.\n\nDuring their digital transformation, the team implemented ODP to fully unify\ncustomer views based on digital interactions, aggregating transactional and\nbehavioral data. This facilitated personalized marketing automation campaigns,\noptimizing fundraising revenue and enhancing donor engagement. The platform's\nkey functionality provided a deeper understanding of customer behavior, allowing\nthe organization to suggest relevant donation amounts based on history. The\norganization's focus on predictive personalization using ODP, Visitor Groups,\nand a custom Machine Learning model exemplifies their commitment to delivering\ntailored recommendations to donors.\n\nAs a charity, Australian Red Cross needs to spend every dollar wisely to\nmaximize positive impact. With efficiency in spend in mind, they adopted Web\nExperimentation to further iterate on their personalization efforts.\n\nPersonalization at scale is the goal to enable data-driven experiences,\nautomation of processes, data integrity and compliance, drive engagement and\nconversion, and create ‘always on’ marketing campaigns.\n\nBrett Wilson\n\nCIO, Australian Red Cross\n\n## Results\n\nOpting for a new DXP marked a significant",

    "content": "# Modular Lighting achieve business success and revitalize commerce offering\n\nwith Optimizely's CMS\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nModular Lighting Instruments, a leading architectural lighting manufacturer,\nembarked on a transformative journey with Optimizely to transition from\ntraditional marketing methods to a dynamic, customer-focused digital strategy.\nThe challenge was clear: their existing marketing efforts were not scalable, and\ntheir online presence was outdated. With the help of Optimizely and partners\nDelaware, Modular Lighting not only revamped their website but also redefined\ntheir entire approach to engaging with customers.\n\n### **Challenge: Transitioning from traditional to digital marketing**\n\nIn 2018, Modular Lighting made the bold decision to fully embrace digital\nmarketing, moving away from their reliance on printed catalogs and trade fair\nbooths. This shift was risky, especially given their limited experience with\ndigital tools. The primary challenge was to create a website that catered not\nonly to resellers but also to interior designers—the end users of their\nproducts. This required a deep understanding of their audience, which led to the\ncreation of \"Aurélie,\" a fictional persona representing their ideal customer.\n\n### **Solution: Optimizely’s role in the transformation**\n\nUnderstanding the needs and behaviors of \"Aurélie\" was crucial in guiding\nModular Lighting’s digital transformation. With Optimizely's content management\nsystem (CMS), Modular Lighting was able to create a dynamic and scalable\nplatform that allowed for real-time content updates and optimization. This shift\nempowered the marketing team to focus on creating meaningful customer\nexperiences rather than being bogged down by technical limitations.\n\nOptimizely's platform also integrated seamlessly with Modular Lighting’s\nexisting systems, including their product information management (PIM) and\ndigital asset management (DAM) systems. This holistic approach ensured that the\nright content reached the right audience at the right time, significantly\nimproving the customer journey.\n\n### **Delaware's partnership elevates Modular Lighting to success**\n\nA critical component of Modular Lighting's successful transformation was the\ninvolvement of Delaware, a long-standing partner known for its expertise in SAP\nsolutions. Delaware played an instrumental role in guiding Modular Lighting\nthrough the complexities of their digital transformation. With their deep\nunderstanding of both the technical and business aspects, Delaware provided\nessential support in implementing and integrating the various systems, including\nOptimizely CMS and Delaware's existing PIM and DAM platforms. Their\napproachability and solution-oriented mindset were key in bridging the gap\nbetween Modular’s marketing and IT teams, ensuring that every decision made was\nin the best interest of the customer. Delaware's involvement not only\nfacilitated the smooth execution of the project but also helped lay the\nfoundation for future digital initiatives, making them an indispensable partner\nin Modular Lighting's journey.\n\n### **Results: A cultural and technological shift**\n\nThe implementation of Optimizely's CMS marked a significant cultural and\ntechnological shift for Modular Lighting. The team moved from a product-centric\nmindset to a customer-centric approach, constantly questioning whether their\nstrategies aligned with the needs of their customers. This cultural shift,\ncombined with the technological advancements enabled by Optimizely, led to a\n\"conversion culture\" within the company.\n\nThe new website, optimized for interior designers, saw a significant improvement\nin user engagement and conversions. The project also laid the groundwork for\nfuture innovations, including a self-service customer portal, a powerful\nrecommendation engine, and enhanced order management systems.\n\n### **Conclusion: Optimizely as a catalyst for future growth**\n\nThe collaboration between Modular Lighting and Optimizely not only addressed\nimmediate challenges but also set the stage for long-term success. By bridging\nthe gap between marketing and IT, and by providing a scalable platform for\ngrowth, Optimizely played a crucial role in Modular Lighting’s ongoing digital\ntransformation. The partnership has positioned Modular Lighting to continue\ninnovating and meeting the evolving needs of their customers in the years to\ncome.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

    "content": "# Macpek sees 86% increase in online revenue\n\nLeading heavy-duty vehicle parts and car wheels distributor, Macpek drives\ndedicated digital engagement with B2B Commerce Cloud\n\n## Macpek parts are made to be on the road with you\n\nFor over 40 years Macpek has been on the leading edge of the heavy-duty vehicle\nparts and car wheels industry. Macpek was founded with a single purpose: to get\ncustomers on the road as quickly and for as long as possible. Today, with over\n70,000 product SKU’s, Macpek is delivering a client experience that is\n_Phenomenal from Part to Part_.\n\nWith over 400,000 feet of warehousing space and 15 locations to be close to\ntheir customers, Macpek promises fast delivery and high quality parts. Macpek’s\ncommitment to an omnichannel strategy means the company is delivering a powerful\nclient experience not only from part to part, but also from channel to channel –\nonline and offline.\n\n## Combating a shortage of talent\n\nWhen you step back and assess the reality of the heavy-duty parts industry\nthere’s an undeniable challenge: talent is scarce because people are not\nchoosing to enter the industry. The heavy-duty vehicle parts industry is\nincredibly specialized and complex and unfortunately, there are not many people\nchoosing to pursue this industry for their career.\n\nFor Macpek, they need to ensure that the existing employees they do have are as\nefficient as possible. To build an efficient team requires robust tools and\ntechnology. Macpek is always searching for ways to augment its teams’ processes\nand provide resources that allow a small number of people to accomplish a lot of\nwork.\n\nAdditionally, for those who are entering the heavy-duty vehicle parts industry,\nthey are driving the organization toward new ways of doing business. The team at\nMacpek knows that younger generations expect seamless digital experiences. They\nexpect to be able to utilize a website to conduct research, make the product\npurchases they need and carry on with their day.\n\n## Committed to growing alongside its digitally-savvy customers\n\nIn the aftermarket parts game, competition is tight. To separate your business\nfrom the fray, you need to be willing to think differently about how to best\nserve your customers. For Macpek, who has always been committed to delivering\nthe highest quality customer service, that meant transforming alongside their\nincreasingly digital-hungry customers.\n\nSo what did transformation look like for Macpek? The company envisioned an\nexperience where customers could self-serve with 24/7 access to real-time\ninventory checkers, centralized product information, order history and invoices.\n\nPrior to leveraging Optimizely's B2B Commerce Cloud, Macpek was using an\neCommerce solution that was not meeting their needs. With no SEO built-in,\nMacpek was finding it challenging to get their products found when people were\ndoing research online. The experience did not meet the expectations of Macpek’s\ncustomers and reflected poorly on the first-rate customer service they were\nstriving to provide.\n\n## A new, more powerful B2B solution\n\nThe Macpek team knew that the issue they had was not with their ERP. Their ERP\nwas fine for managing the back-office processes. What they needed was a tool to\ncreate an excellent experience on the user side. As a result, when searching for\na new eCommerce platform, one of the most important requirements was that the\nsolution would easily integrate with Macpek’s This would enable crucial\ninformation like inventory and pricing to be shared across systems and not\nduplicated.\n\nIn addition to integration to its ERP, Macpek was looking for a solution that\nwould provide a real-time inventory checker to its customers, could handle more\nthan 63,000 price matrix combinations and could manage product information for\nmore than 100,000 products. Further importance was placed on enhanced search and\nresponsive design.\n\nMacpek was working with Absolunet, a North American eCommerce Agency during its\nhunt for the right fit. Absolunet suggested that Optimizely's B2B Commerce Cloud\nhad the capabilities and features needed to handle the complex challenges Macpek\nwas facing.\n\n## Improving the bottom line\n\nSince implementing Optimizely's B2B Commerce Cloud, Macpek has seen an 86%\nincrease in online revenue. Today, Macpek is opening three to four new accounts\nper day and sees an average of 8,000 monthly website transactions.\n\nBut the results go beyond new business. The platform has also enabled the team\nto be more efficient than ever before. Macpek is utilizing the platform as a\ntraining tool for new team members. Utilizing the platform as an onboarding tool\nhas reduced the training period for team members from one year to just three\nmonths, a 9 month reduction in training time. Now, Macpek’s team can provide\nmore valuable customer service while augmenting processes that had previously\nbeen conducted by people.\n\nAll in all, Optimizely's B2B Commerce Cloud solution has enabled Macpek’s\ncustomers to self-serve while driving internal efficiencies and generating more\nrevenue. Macpek is continuously innovating and constantly looking for ways to\nmake the customer experience even more phenomenal from part to part.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.macpek.com/",

    "content": "# New B2B platform increased Carl Ras conversion rates by 20%\n\n## At a glance\n\n- 35% Incremental online sales\n- 10% Increased average order value\n- 20% Increased conversion rate\n\nThe Carl Ras wholesale company is pursuing its digitalization strategy with a\nclear vision of being the construction professional’s preferred supplier and\nproviding customers with a totally new online experience.\n\nCarl Ras offers a wide range of tools, fittings, work clothes and safety\nequipment to construction and industry professionals. The company operates in a\ncompetitive market where the industry leader is the best and fastest at helping\ncustomers get their work done: These days, this entails ensuring all products\nare available and searchable via the web, cell phones and apps.\n\nCarl Ras set a target of increasing online sales as a share of business turnover\nfrom 4 to 10 percent, with total sales growing correspondingly. The existing web\nplatform was an obvious obstacle to growth, leaving much to be desired in terms\nof scalability, overview and, most importantly, convenience for shoppers. It was\nalso unwieldy to administer. With more than 40,000 item, the Carl Ras range\nrequires constant changes that took up too much time for employees.\n\nTo develop a new B2B ecommerce solution, Carl Ras turned to Impact, an ecommerce\nspecialists and Optimizely Gold Solution Partner in Denmark. Carl Ras was\nlooking for a solution that not only offered a better shopper experience but\nalso made its internal work easier.\n\nIn order to create a future-proof solution, Carl Ras decided to modernize its IT\narchitecture. This investment includes adaptation to the cloud, development of\napplications based on micro-services and a commerce platform built according to\nthe headless principle.\n\nThe new architecture makes it possible to reuse services across the entire\nbusiness and replace underlying systems without the need to revamp shopper-\noriented applications. The IT architecture surrounding integrations and data\nwarehouses has been rewritten to enable a consistent omnichannel shopping\nexperience.\n\nCarl Ras had many compelling reasons to choose Optimizely as its ecommerce\nplatform. What set Optimizely apart was its user-friendly content asset\nmanagement and the fact that the platform is available in the cloud, with good\nopportunities for integration with Microsoft Azure.\n\n## **Rewarding to include customer feedback**\n\nAt the start of the project, customers and other stakeholders were interviewed\nso that their feedback could be incorporated into development work. It emerged\nthat supervisors spent many hours ordering materials for their employees and\ncoordinating various construction projects, addresses, customers and payers. The\nsolution, therefore, needed to focus on speeding up the ordering process,\nimproving the overview and making it easier for construction supervisors to\ndelegate purchasing to their employees.\n\nNavigation and menu structure have been designed to be more user-friendly and\nfocused. When a customer logs in to the Carl Ras website, it displays their\npersonalized prices, discounts, delivery methods and delivery terms.\n\nThe customer is also able to set up multiple construction sites to keep track of\nthe material for different projects. One example is the possibility of\nsimultaneously ordering items for several construction sites, placing them in a\ncommon shopping cart and having each item directed to their respective\nworkplace.\n\nThe new option for the customer to delegate purchasing responsibility not only\nhelps to make the process more efficient but also makes it possible to customize\nthe shopping experience for different employees. Meanwhile, there is a\nconvenient authorization feature that enables managers to check and approve\norders quickly.\n\nCarl Ras now offers ecommerce not only online, but also through apps for mobile\nusers. For example, datasheets for products in use can be downloaded, so that\nup-to-date safety information is available to professionals on a construction\nsite.\n\n## **Marketing initiatives are measured in real-time**\n\nThe new solution includes a reporting platform and dashboard, which collects\ndata from Google Analytics and the business system. This enables Carl Ras to see\nhow its online and offline merchandising is impacting sales, and to measure\nefficacy based on the cost of each channel.\n\nPreviously, it took Carl Ras 24 hours to produce performance-related data, while\nthe new interface displays the information in real-time. This makes it easy to\nre-prioritize marketing activities and select the most effective channels to\ngenerate upselling.\n\nThe solution showed promising results in a short space of time. Shoppers have\nreceived a lightning-fast website and the number of visitors has increased\nsignificantly. Editors can perform their work much more efficiently, which means\nfaster time-to-market for new ventures. Editing work has also been reduced by\n50%.\n\nI’ve never been so proud to launch a new website. Despite a complex set of\nfactors, we can live up to our motto that shoppers should always be able to find\nwhat they’re looking for.\n\nMorten Jørgensen\n\nDigital Innovation Lead, Carl Ras\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Content Management System\n- Feature Experimentation",

Originally a joint venture between the Sennheiser\nGroup and Demant, the latter company took over the business and launched EPOS as\na new brand.\n\nA digital journey was set in motion, and just eight months later, EPOS audio\nproducts were ready to ship in more than 160 markets and across 60 currencies.\nThe journey not only involved building a new brand and tech stack – for the EPOS\nteam; it also meant leveling up internal processes.\n\nOn the agenda was a clear-cut strategy for planning and implementing a digital\ninfrastructure to drive EPOS’ platforms for B2C sales and B2B leads, one that\ncombined brand content and commerce.\n\nEPOS sought to leverage automation wherever possible. Selecting the Optimizely\nCommerce Cloud as the base for their content hub – the Headless API – provided a\nfully flexible architecture that enabled EPOS to support all markets using a\nsingle content platform. With just a few clicks, staff can easily make real-time\nchanges to pricing, currencies, product range, payment options and much more.\n\nWorking with digital commerce solutions specialists Impact, an Optimizely Gold\nSolution Partner, EPOS could break down a complex business at record speed and\nplan their digital journey.

Across project management, design sparring,\ndevelopment and content, EPOS’ needs were turned into solutions and implemented\non a global scale.\n\n## **A solid tech foundation**\n\nDeveloping EPOS’ tech stack involved a digital project with multiple tracks\nconducted simultaneously – from ERP (Microsoft AX), CRM, PIM to the new\ncustomer-facing sales-platform, hosted on Azure.\n\nTo support B2B and B2C using a single platform, EPOS decided to go with\nOptimizely.

But the company\nneeded the ability to simultaneously experiment with different web pages across\nits 17 different websites in order to achieve this goal.\n\nCanon EMEA recognized the need for a robust experimentation and optimization\nplatform, which led the company to select Optimizely as its dedicated partner in\nthis area.\n\nOptimizely is now being used across several of Canon EMEA’s business functions,\nbut predominantly by the ecommerce team. The platform is used to carry out high\nvelocity A/B testing across the company’s 17 different websites to understand\nhow different site elements perform. Using various qualitative and quantitative\nresearch tools, the team are able to gather data and insights into the website’s\nconversion rates and traffic figures.\n\nThe testing is currently being carried out across five key website areas,\nincluding the homepage, the navigation area, product pages, and the checkout and\nbasket pages. The test results provide the team with statistically significant\nresults that improve the website’s conversion rate and other key metrics.\n\nThese changes made to the key site areas are then deployed across the full\nwebsite to all customers. Once any pain points or problems are identified, Canon\nEMEA’s cross-functional in-house team — comprising of UX designers, copywriters\nand conversion rate optimization leads — is able to quickly make any iterations\nor create new test concepts to roll out across its web pages via the Optimizely\nplatform.\n\nOptimizely is an extremely powerful, yet simple tool to use. Our team is now\nempowered to constantly review and experiment with different aspects of the\ncustomer experience. Optimizely is helping us to remove the element of guesswork\nthat was previously needed. This guesswork has now been replaced with data-\ndriven results which allow us to deliver seamless, omnichannel experiences.\n\nJitender Chani\n\ne-Commerce Content & Optimization Senior Manager , Canon EMEA\n\n## Removing the digital guesswork\n\nOptimizely’s experimentation capabilities have enabled the team at Canon EMEA to\nimplement a robust experimentation programme that can run high velocity tests\nsimultaneously across a wide range of markets. As a result, the team can turn\nthese test results into actionable changes in order to deliver a seamless\nomnichannel experience across each of its different markets.\n\nJitender Chani, Canon EMEA’s e-Commerce Content & optimization Senior Manager\nexplains, “Optimizely is an extremely powerful, yet simple tool to use. Through\nthe platform, we are now able to see which test concepts are driving the highest\nconversion rates and how this metric is changing over time. Thanks to Optimizely\nwe are able to set up an array of different tests in little time, which run\nextremely well and deliver fast results.\n\n“Our team is now empowered to constantly review and experiment with different\naspects of the customer experience, and Optimizely is helping us to remove the\nelement of guesswork that was previously needed. This guesswork has now been\nreplaced with data-driven results which allow us to deliver seamless,\nomnichannel experiences.”\n\nWhile Canon EMEA is predominantly using Optimizely’s experimentation\ncapabilities, the company has recently expanded its partnership and is now\nbuilding out its personalization and content recommendation strategies using\nOptimizely to drive even higher conversion rates and in turn, better and bigger\nbusiness outcomes.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation",

How do we feed the planet,\n\nhow do we take care of people?''\n\nOptimizely sat down with David Postill, Senior Vice President Marketing &\nCustomer Experience at AGI.\n\nHe begins by telling us about the initiation of AGI. ''Well, we describe\nourselves as a food infrastructure company. So, we started in the agricultural\nequipment business in Western Canada, selling one piece of equipment in one\nsmall region. In the grain farming business, you have a whole pile of what are\ncalled short line pieces of equipment; augers, conveyors, storage bins, fans,\nheaters, silos. And so, the company started by consolidating those pieces of\nequipment and offering it as a total solution. And that allowed us to grow from\nbeing just exclusively a farm agricultural supplier of equipment to a broader\nfood infrastructure''.\n\nAGI are the leading grain handling business, often recognized as the flagship\nequipment manufacturers in the global agriculture industry. Their products\noperate across 6 continents and in turn, service millions of end-users.\n\nTheir customers consist of farm businesses, individual farmers who buy equipment\nthrough dealers or direct, all the way to large engineering and procurement\noperators. This diverse mix means there is never a single customer view - a\nchallenge AGI are proactively responding to.\n\n## Serving resonating products and services according to geography\n\nWith the various markets AGI operate, we asked David whether there was a stark\ndifference in offering. He tells us, ''North America [is] very different from\nhow we go to market in Brazil or South America. Very different from how we go to\nmarket in the Middle East or Europe, for that matter. Products, offerings,\npositionings, our branding even, is very different geography to geography''.\n\nAGI relied on a non-coherent, complex infastructure to serve global markets\ndigitally. Their legacy infrastructure comprised of;\n\n- 42 different unique web properties\n- 5 languages\n- 16 different software platforms,\n- Confused piping\n- CMS systems that weren't all knitted together\n\nAs AGI grew, they shifted their focus on marrying all digital web properties on\nto one, seamless platform that would enhance their proposition.\n\nOn his mission, David explains, ''I was brought in three years ago to take what\nthey had and make it modern digital, global, and efficient. So it's one of the\nreasons we landed on working with Optimizely''.\n\nOptimizely Content Cloud is the robust, scalable solution AGI rely upon today.\nSitting on Microsoft Azure, Content Cloud enables AGI to quickly create powerful\ndigital experiences in every territory they operate. Instead of a disparate,\ncomplex web of digital software solutions, Optimizely delivers content and\npersonalization on one platform.\n\nSo people land on the homepage, they engage with our content and they move\nthrough the experience. So the metrics are all fantastic right now. They're\nsignificantly over everywhere we were.\n\nDavid Postill\n\nSVP, AGI\n\nDavid describes Optimizely as a powerful, tactical tool that is, ''super\nflexible, super customizable, but in a very easy way. You've got great\ntemplates. We've been able to build up cool and flexible customizations. It's a\nvery user-friendly experience. I also think that you have exactly the right\nfunctionality for us in well-constructed modules that we can add as we grow over\ntime''.\n\nWhen it comes to the strategic steps David and AGI have undertaken to proportion\nthe right experiences to different markets we hear that AGI, ''provide a\nplatform for seed, for fertilizer, for grain, for feed and then for food'', he\nmentions. ''Each of those platforms have their own unique demands, their own\ncustomer buying journeys, their own marketing challenges that are also slice and\ndice by geography around the world''. David then describes how their digital\nplatform performs to create an eco-system for these channels. ''We have to build\nmarketing solutions, web platforms that on one hand work with a dealer channel\nin North America, on the other hand work directly with end users or growers in\nEurope. And the expectation for a tool to be highly flexible, easily\ncustomizable, content driven is paramount to our success''.\n\n## Feeeding the appetite of digital farmers\n\nWhen talking about customer experience, David shares, ''I think a good customer\nexperience, obviously, begins by just understanding what's important to our\ncustomers. And that's more than just clicks and links as to what's going on in\ntheir lives. In the food production industry, there is a ton of pressure from\nsustainability point of view, from an environmental point of view, from a use of\nresources point of view. In different parts of the world they're having a\ndifferent experiences right now in terms of what's important to them.''\n\nAs David puts it, Optimizely is helping AGI, ''with the rollout of the website\nwe were able to go see, and this is what it's supposed to look like, and this is\nhow we should go to market''.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.aggrowth.com/",

The company recognized that its\nformer approach to experimentation lacked cohesion, focusing on specific\nelements of the signup process without considering the holistic flow. With a\nlaser focus on enhancing the end-to-end user journey, ClassPass leveraged the\nOptimizely’s dynamic experimentation platform to create a seamless and\ncaptivating signup process.\n\nPast user surveys and exit intent surveys conducted revealed significant\nopportunities for improvement. A portion of potential customers cited confusion\nabout ClassPass' credit system as a primary reason for not signing up. In\nresponse, ClassPass formed a cross-functional team involving marketing, UX\ndesign, and engineering to collaboratively drive the redesign process. The\nteam's alignment marked a pivotal moment, as it fostered a unified approach to\ndesign and testing, effectively breaking down silos that had previously existed.\nThis collective effort aimed to ensure that the redesign addressed various\nfriction points identified through user feedback.\n\n## Examples of new and intuitive designs\n\n**Image 1 - mobile-friendly designs for CTAs, easy-to-read walkthrough before\nsignup flow**\n\n**Image 2 - new credits explainer web page to address common questions about how\nClassPass credits work**\n\nThe redesign process took place primarily on the mobile website to enable\nfocused and rapid iteration. The ClassPass team began with wireframing, mapping\nout the flow of information to ensure that common user questions were addressed\ncohesively. Optimizely’s powerful experimentation platform allowed ClassPass to\nswiftly develop lightweight prototypes for swift feedback collection, followed\nby user testing to gauge user comprehension and reactions to the proposed\nchanges. The iterative approach to design based on user feedback aimed to align\nthe redesigned experience with user expectations.\n\nThroughout the website redesign, a balance between aesthetics and performance\nwas struck. The team decided not to pursue certain visually appealing design\nelements that might compromise page loading speed and overall performance.\n\nClassPass' strategic redesign initiative, driven by user-centric insights,\ncross-functional collaboration and Optimizely’s A/B testing capabilities,\nresulted in an enhanced mobile website experience. The focus on clarity,\ncomprehensibility, and speed ultimately aimed to address the credit system\nconfusion and encourage sign-ups. The iterative approach, combined with a\nthoughtful use of design elements for performance optimization, illustrated\nClassPass' commitment to delivering a user experience that aligns with user\nexpectations and facilitates ease of navigation and interaction.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLooking ahead, ClassPass envisions extending its well-established\nexperimentation program to various other dimensions of its offerings. Nina\nBayatti detailed that the company has developed a thriving corporate program,\nallowing HR managers to facilitate subsidized ClassPass memberships as part of\nemployee benefits. This initiative has gained significant traction, attracting\nthe participation of renowned companies worldwide.\n\nAs the corporate program continues to gain prominence, the company's focus is\nnow directed towards optimizing the user journey for HR managers and employees\nengaging with the program. This strategic shift towards experimentation in this\ndomain provides an exciting opportunity to explore a fresh demographic, gaining\ninsights into the distinct requirements and preferences of both employers and\nemployees.\n\nWith the rapid expansion of the corporate program, the subsequent increase in\ntraffic offers ClassPass ample prospects for rigorous testing and iterative\nenhancements. This new avenue of experimentation holds promise as it expands\nClassPass' understanding of user dynamics and aspirations within the corporate\nlandscape, paralleling the successful approach employed on the consumer-facing\nside of the platform.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n- Feature Experimentation",

Learn more now.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nFounded in 886, The Royal Mint is one of the oldest organizations in the world.\nAt their factory in Wales, they manufacture currency coinage for the U.K. as\nwell as currency for other countries around the world.\n\n10 years ago, The Royal Mint recognized that the use of coins in society was\ndiminishing, and it was time to diversify their business. They introduced a\ncommercial consumer line of business for commemorative coin, which celebrates\nhistoric people and events. They also expanded into precious metals, enabling\ncustomers to invest, buy, and sell precious metals. And they introduced\ncollector services to support coin collectors in their purchasing and selling of\nhistorical coins.\n\nWhen they made the strategic decision to diversify, they recognized that a\nstrong ecommerce website with experimentation and personalization capabilities\nwould be crucial to their transformation journey. They decided to partner with\nOptimizely, the world’s first marketing operating system, to build an all-new\ndigital presence. **Solution**\n\nTheir first requirement was to integrate their enterprise resource planning\n(ERP) system into their CMS. With Optimizely, they were able to build a\nseamlessly integrated system.\n\nNow, every time a purchase is made from The Royal Mint website, the transaction\nfeeds into their ERP. This allows them to instantly understand what products\ncustomers are buying and what to manufacture next in their factory.\n\n### **Scaling website security and speed through high-demand**\n\nAs a government, finance, and investment-oriented business, website security and\nperformance were also important for The Royal Mint. The team liked that the\nPaaS-version of Optimizely Content Management System is hosted by Microsoft\nAzure, so they can benefit from Azure’s scalability, reliability, performance,\nand security.\n\nToday, The Royal Mint uses Optimizely’s CMS to manage multiple websites, and\nexperiences significant spikes in traffic with every product launch. They rely\non Optimizely's compatibility with Cloudflare to ensure their websites remain\nsecure and performant through heavy spikes in traffic.\n\n### **Up-leveling an already successful experimentation program**\n\nAs a brand, The Royal Mint is focused on providing the very best service to the\ncustomer. Understanding that testing and iteration is key to optimizing the\ncustomer experience, they already had a healthy experimentation program in\nplace.\n\nWith Optimizely, they were able to expand their experimentation. They tested the\nplacement of key CTAs on their site, and used A/B and multivariate testing (MVT)\nto support high-impact changes to their content and the layout of their content\non key product pages.\n\nThe team combines their experimentation learnings with user feedback to make\nincremental improvements to their website’s UI, leading to the best possible\ncustomer experiences.\n\nThe Optimizely One platform allows us to create a really immersive experience\nfor the customer using our commerce platform and CMS, then apply web\nexperimentation to help us test those customer journeys quickly and effectively,\nand roll out that new customer experience.\n\nRich Hobbs\n\nGroup Technology Director\n\n## **Results**\n\nThe Royal Mint launches more than 30 new products a year and sees considerable\nspikes in web traffic with each launch. The day of King Charles III’s\ncoronation, traffic to their website peaked at 1.4 million page views, 200,000\nsessions, and 200 payments per minute.\n\n“These spikes in traffic are normal and are a real indication of the way that\ntraffic can be handled with Optimizely One,” says Hobbs. “Being able to manage\nthose spikes in traffic effectively and give every customer the same experience\nis superb.”\n\nBy using experimentation to improve the placement of “Buy Now” and “Add to\nBasket” buttons on their site, The Royal Mint saw a 20% increase in conversions.\nThey also increased purchases of their subscription products by more than 50%,\nusing A/B and multivariate testing.\n\n### **What’s Next?**\n\nThe Royal Mint team isn’t stopping there. Next they will implement Optimizely\nData Platform to take advantage of more cross-platform integrations and enable\nmore customized experiences for every customer.\n\nThe",

AutoScout24 uses A/B testing on almost every page\nacross their website in order to learn about their users and continually improve\ntheir online experience. They discovered that small changes can have a major\nimpact and using Optimizely, they have been able to triple their product\nrevenue.\n\nLearn more about AutoScout24's testing culture and how they use Optimizely to\nimprove conversion and drive measurable business results (video in German).\n\nOne part of their site that AutoScout24 optimized is their online contact form,\na critical first step in all new transactions on their site. See how AutoScout24\nused user feedback to increase form submissions by 21.6%.\n\n## Challenge\n\nBuying a car is an emotional process; not only is it a major investment for most\nbuyers, but it’s often a significant life milestone. In the used car market,\ncommunication between the seller and buyer is vital for sharing information\nabout the car’s condition, price and any other details.\n\nFor AutoScout24, Europe's largest marketplace for new and used cars, all\ntransactions start with an online contact form. It is a widely used part of the\nwebsite that is crucial to their customers’ success: finding a car that’s a\nperfect match. In a user research study, AutoScout24 discovered usability\nproblems with filling out the text box in the form and diagnosed this as a\npossible cause of low conversion rates.\n\nCar shoppers said they were not completing the contact form because they did not\nknow how to communicate to the seller.\n\nThe team used Optimizely and partnered with the team at DieProduktMacher GmbH\n(an Optimizely solutions partner) to turn the user feedback into action, hoping\nthey would be able to prove they had solved this usability issue while\nincreasing the conversion rate on the contact form.\n\nThanks to Optimizely, we tripled the revenue from our product over the last 3\nyears. This would not have been possible without A/B testing.\n\nSolvig van Severen\n\nAutoScout24\n\nBased on feedback from the usability study, the agency hypothesized that\nproviding more pre-filled information in the form and decreasing the amount of\noriginal thinking (or effort) the shopper has to do would increase form\nsubmissions. The agency designed three variations of a form with different\ntreatment of the pre-filled information as checkboxes, a drop-down menu, and\npre-populated text box.\n\n“The less the user is forced to interact with the form, the greater the\nlikelihood of a conversion,” Tobias, Chief Data Scientist at DieProduktMacher\nsaid.\n\n## Test variations\n\nThey tested three new form designs to determine which format would lead to the\nmost form submissions.\n\n_The original version of the contact form: blank fields and text boxes for a\nbuyer to complete and send to the car seller._\n\n#### Variation 1: drop-down list\n\n_They tested the impact of a drop-down list of reasons to contact the seller as\ncited in the usability survey._\n\n#### Variation 2: checkboxes\n\n_They tested the same contact reasons in a checkbox format._\n\n#### Variation 3: pre-filled text box\n\n_They tested a form pre-filled with text, 'Hello. I am interested in your\nvehicle. Please contact me. Kind regards.'_\n\n### Results\n\nAfter running this experiment with Optimizely, AutoScout24 learned that all\nthree form variations outperformed the original. Variation 3 with pre-filled\ntext was the highest performer, increased conversion rate on the form to 1.5%\nfrom 1.2%, a relative conversion increase of 21.6%.\n\n## Key takeaway\n\n#### User feedback generates high-impact hypotheses\n\nAs this case study highlights, tests that directly address real user problems\nadd measurable value. AutoScout24 and DieProduktMacher GmbH used data from the\nusability survey to identify the problem, generate their hypothesis, and design\nvariations for this experiment. The common reasons shoppers cited for contacting\na seller became the content of the text used in the variations and ultimately\nbecame a crucial part of the user experience. Using direct user feedback to\ninform test hypotheses leads to more impactful tests that generate measurable\nimprovements in conversion.\n\nTesting and data-driven decision-making is engrained in AutoScout's DNA. The\nteam tests payment processes, search & sharing functionality, landing pages and\nnew product features before they go live to make sure they build products that\npeople will actually use.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation",

Everyone involved with the project had an obligation to ensure secure\nprogramming across every layer, strengthening collaboration thoughout the\nproject.\n\n## Realizing the strategic objective\n\nFeatures such as bank transfers, topping up loans, card processing, and secure\nmessaging between the bank and the customer were included in the new solution.\nKnowit developed a new dynamic loan form for potential bank customers, where\neverything is completed digitally. The customer can apply for a loan, receive\nnotifications, sign in using BankID or mobile BankID, and get money directly in\nthe account. The features were implemented with micro-interactions with helpful\nengagements to enhance the user experience.\n\nIt is easier to perform banking functions and subscribe to new products, which\nattracts more and more satisfied customers. The project realized our strategic\nobjective for the new online banking\n\nPeter Leijon Spjuth\n\nManager of Digital Channels, Santander Consumer Bank\n\n#### Industry\n\nFinancial services\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://santanderconsumer.dk/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nKnowit AB\n\nKnowit provides knowledge in at the area of communication, commerce and\ncollaboration on the web, mobile and new media.",

They are also a turn-key agricultural project company\nexecuting huge projects for farmers, corporates, and governments. The B2B\nmanufacturers operate a complex business environment with distribution partners,\nsuppliers and dealers and have been doing so for years. With new digital\ncapabilities, the company is looking for a stronger connection with the end\nuser: the farmer, in order to increase demand to their offering.\n\nAlthough the end user is typically a farmer, the chain has many layers, from\ndistribution partners to NGOs and governments. All these are located across the\nglobe, meaning collaborations from India to Italy, Mexico to China.\n\n## The journey to personalization\n\nNetafim also take advantage of personalization features including visitor\ngroups. They smartly develop personas against the agencies they cater to,\nincluding farmers, investors, and governments. That way, they understand whether\nthe chosen direction is the right one, whilst delivering super relevant content\nacross the site.\n\nNetafim have made the content simpler and applied storytelling techniques at\nsuch a level that someone from outside the sector understands the general scope\nof our products and services. Technical details and customized calculations help\na buyer through their buying journey. The final deal is done offline. Providing\nvaluable information online and tools that convert visitors into new customers\nis a priority.\n\n## This sector has always been very traditional. People really do not approach\n\nyou through digital channels\n\nThe entire industry thought small farmers, that could not be reached online,\nwould be digitally inept. Netafim rejected that idea. They are finalizing the\nglobal infrastructure of 16 website with another 10 added in 2020.\n\n## Content strategy that provides access to all\n\nThere are millions of farmers worldwide that on the outskirts of being reached,\nbut they do access Netafim thanks to searches in Google, or Yandex in Russia and\nBaidu in China.

    "content": "# How 8 MORSCO brands evolved with B2B Commerce Cloud\n\n## A deeply rooted, century-long commitment to providing high quality products\n\nThough MORSCO was founded in November 2011, its roots date all the way back to 1917. MORSCO derived its name from one of its powerhouse plumbing supply brands,\nMorrison Supply Company, whose nickname was MORSCO for decades after its\ninception.\n\nThroughout the course of nine decades, Morrison had become the strongest\nindependent plumbing supply company in the Southwest. By 2011, Morrison had\naggressive goals to expand and become the nation’s leading plumbing and HVAC\ndistributor by assembling the very best regional businesses and people in their\nindustry.\n\nThe expansion kicked into gear in January 2012 when MORSCO added 13 new\nlocations in Southern California and acquired Express Pipe & Supply. Just as\nthey set out to do, over the next few years MORSCO opened more locations and\nassembled the best talent by acquiring more businesses.\n\nToday, MORSCO is a leading U.S. distributor of commercial and residential\nplumbing, waterworks, heating and cooling equipment (HVAC), and pipe, valves and\nfittings (PVF) and is comprised of a family of eight long-established local\ndistributors. MORSCO distributes more than 100,000 national and private label\nproducts to more than 40,000 customers.\n\nOptimizely Configured Commerce is one of the leading eCommerce platforms for\nB2B. Optimizely Configured Commerce understands the complexities of B2B right\nout of the box.\n\nDarren Taylor\n\nChief Marketing Officer, MORSCO\n\n## Responding to customers’ changing expectations\n\nFor decades, distribution businesses have been run on relationships. People buy\nfrom people. People trust people. As technology has advanced, customers’\nexpectations have evolved. Customers still expect strong relationships, but they\nalso expect to be able to leverage technology to do business.\n\nThat’s why for distributors like MORSCO, digital transformation is essential. To\nsurvive and bring their business into the future, MORSCO had to respond to\nchanging customer expectations – they needed solutions that would serve\ncustomers exactly how they wanted to be served, 24 hours a day, seven days per\nweek.\n\nChanging customer expectations and competitive pressures drove MORSCO to build\nand invest in a robust ecommerce strategy. Prior to 2015, none of MORSCO’s\nbrands were leveraging an ecommerce platform. The company knew they had to make\nchanges.\n\n## Key priorities in leveraging ecommerce\n\nWhen they first launched their journey into ecommerce and transformation,\nMORSCO’s key priority was to make it easier for customers to conduct business\nwith them. In addition, they wanted to improve organizational efficiencies and\nprovide better service at a lower cost for both the customer and the company as\na whole. Traditionally, MORSCO sales representatives spent valuable time and\nresources completing tasks like checking orders, generating quotes, checking\ninvoices and more – things an ecommerce platform would excel at.\n\nEfficiency and ease of doing business weren’t the only goals MORSCO set for\necommerce. The company also knew that with the right strategy and the right\ntechnology, ecommerce would set them up to grow share of wallet with current\ncustomers and acquire new customers through digital marketing.\n\n**Meeting the complexities of B2B**\n\nThere are multiple complexities involved in MORSCO’s business. The company is\nmade up of multiple brands, serves a diverse set of customers and provides a\nlarge breadth of products. When MORSCO began their search for the right\necommerce platform, they needed technology that was built for the complexities.\n\nMORSCO needed to build an experience that would accommodate complex online\ntransactions, specific to a customer’s particular wants or needs. They needed to\nprovide their customers more control over what, when, and how they could access\naccount information, including invoice retrieval, order status and other\ninformation.\n\nThey recognized that it wasn’t just about deploying a simple website. For\nMORSCO, building an eCommerce solution was about bringing relationships and\nprocesses together. They needed to serve customers that had multiple roles and\nmultiple processes with different authority levels and budgets.\n\n**Launching ecommerce for Farnsworth**\n\nIn 2017, MORSCO launched its first online experience for the Farnsworth brand.\nLeveraging Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, MORSCO transformed a rarely accessed,\narchaic product information library into an easily viewable and downloadable\nproduct catalog containing vital information like installation guides,\nwarranties and spec sheets. The site enabled customers to easily search product\ninformation, get real-time product availability and accelerate the ordering\nprocess through online cart and checkout functionality.\n\nNot long after its implementation, the Farnsworth solution delivered remarkable\nresults for the company. With critical and otherwise time consuming tasks like\nquoting, invoices and proof of delivery being handled online, the solution saved\nassociates hours every week. Less than 6 months after implementation, more than\n25% of Farnsworth orders were being placed online. In addition, overall sales\nincreased by 10% just one year after implementation.\n\n**MORSCO’s online solutions**\n\nFollowing Farnsworth, Morrisonsupply.com was the next site to launch. By the end\nof 2017 MORSCO had six of MORSCO’s eight brands online. Today, all the brands\nleverage Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud.\n\nEach of MORSCO’s online solutions offer a personalized experience that includes:\n\n- Access to more than 200,000 products with technical documents organized into customer-specific catalogs\n- Real-time pricing and local availability\n- Access to invoices, proof of delivery and other account information\n- Integration with a customer’s purchasing system and job management tools\n- 24",

With about 100 employees in total,\nE-Wheels and its sister companies also sell water sports equipment and workout\nequipment, with electric vehicles being the focus for E-Wheels.\n\nE-Wheels kicked off its business with electric unicycles. Business took off in\n2018 when new legislation for electric scooters passed in Norway and e-scooters\nand electric bikes were introduced as part of E-Wheels’ key offer.With a first-\nmover advantage, E-Wheels contributed to the green shift and made micromobility\naccessible to more than 150,000 customers. E-Wheels’ customer base includes\ncommuters in Scandinavia and Europe, with the occasional B2B customer.\n\nE-Wheels credits its success to offering transportation that is affordable,\nsafe, and fast. It also prides itself on fast delivery and excellent customer\nservice throughout the buying journey as well as post-purchase assistance.As\nelectric vehicles require maintenance to ensure the safety of users, E-Wheels is\ncurrently expanding its workshop locations throughout Norway and Sweden to ease\nthe service process. Customers can also opt to purchase replacement parts via\nthe E-Wheels website.\n\n## The need for an automated, scalable solution\n\nAt first, the team believed having good products that meet customer needs was\nsufficient. Upgrading the company’s website and overall customer experience was\nnot on the team’s radar as the company’s prior platform worked satisfactorily.\n\nHowever, E-Wheels soon realized its digital solution was too simplistic and\ncould not scale with the type of growth E-Wheels was experiencing. While\nE-Wheels products were being sold out at lightning speed, the team struggled to\nhandle the large amounts of orders as internal processes were manual and could\nonly accommodate the bare minimum. Although E-Wheels’ previous platform could\nhandle its site traffic just fine, there was no automation to integrate\nprocesses such as product management, order management, and more. Chief\nInformation Officer of E-Wheels, Markus Søderlind, shared that updates to\nE-Wheels’ internal system and stock counts were done manually as and when\ncontainer shipments were delivered. This caused a delay in inventory updates as\nwell as inaccurate delivery dates for customers.The printing of airway bills,\nwhile seemingly minor, also became increasingly difficult to manage as there was\nno integration between airway bill generation and orders received. As E-Wheels\nwanted to retain customers, it attempted to recommend relevant products based on\na customer’s purchase history. However, this was all done manually as its\nprevious platform did not have the capabilities to execute data-backed\nrecommendations.\n\n## Setting things in motion with Optimizely\n\nThe E-Wheels team eventually accepted that their prior platform was insufficient\nfor the future of the business. They started looking for other solution\nproviders, ranging from those suited for smaller businesses to those often used\nby enterprises. After comparing multiple solutions with E-Wheels’ business\ntrajectory, the team decided on Optimizely as their solutions provider and Geta\nas their Optimizely partner. The relationship between E-Wheels and Geta was\ngreat from the get-go. Thanks to Geta’s robust experience with Optimizely,\nE-Wheels viewed the Geta team as an integral part of its new sites’ development,\nas well as other site optimization processes including SEO. The E-Wheels team\nleveraged Optimizely’s Product Management capabilities to update its catalog of\nmore than 2,000 SKUs with rich product information including key details,\ncustomer reviews, AR view of products as well as product safety reminders. With\na large catalog, E-Wheels utilized Search & Navigation to facilitate an easy way\nto browse for products by providing site users with detailed filtering options.\nOptimizely’s Content Management also comes into play by providing the team with\nan easy way to publish content to update customers and keep them engaged. While\nE-Wheels’ prior solution had no issues handling its site traffic, Søderlind\nshared that Optimizely’s platform security and ability to handle huge spikes in\ntraffic played a huge role in E-Wheels choosing Optimizely. The ability to\ndetect suspicious traffic activity has helped put the E-Wheels team’s mind at\nease as they can rely on Optimizely to flag unusual events.Optimizely’s Single\nSign-On capability also helped the E-Wheels team streamline internal workflows\nby enabling easy but secure access to their Optimizely tools. With Optimizely’s\nfrequent and up-to-date notifications on license renewals and software updates,\nE-Wheels is also able to stay compliant and on top of its game.\n\nA key advantage of Optimizely is its hosting abilities. As E-Wheels grows, we\nget more traffic. We receive exponential site traffic during campaign periods\nand having a solid platform that ensures site uptime prevents revenue loss. That\nis very important to us!\n\nMarkus Søderlind\n\nChief Information Officer, E-Wheels\n\n## Growing the E-Wheels market share with Optimizely\n\nSince moving four of its 13 websites onto Optimizely in April 2021, E-Wheels has\nseen more than double the number of orders and a 90% growth in revenue compared\nto its previous platform.

E-Wheels successfully improved customer experience\nwith its new digital solution’s intuitive navigation and rich content. With a\nflexible platform, E-Wheels could work on market expansions without worrying\nabout the scalability of its platform. In addition, automating workflows with\nOptimizely improved internal efficiency and time-savings for E-Wheels. E-Wheels\nleveraged the notifications as an opportunity to cross-sell and upsell with\nautomated “notify when back in stock” emails sent out to prospective customers.\nThis not only provides customers with assurance and reduces stock-related\ninquiries but increases the opportunity for better customer service and\nengagement. Customers are also informed of the in-person pickup option with\ninformation on inventory levels at the nearest physical branch. Customers can\nthen choose to pick up in store as a freight option in the checkout section. The\noverall flow of communication has improved for a more user-friendly experience.\nE-Wheels aim to improve this experience further by adding a “click & collect”\nfeature directly on each product page.Søderlind shared that E-Wheels is\nconfident of its industry-leading platform that helps the company stay ahead of\nthe curve, improve its overall reputation as well as accelerate growth and\nsales.\n\n## The future of E-Wheels\n\nE-Wheels has plans to emulate its Norway success in Sweden as well as grow its\nmarket share in electric bikes. Electric bikes will also be made available in\nits Europe offering next year. A customer club loyalty program will also be\nintroduced later this year, with the aim of enhancing E-Wheel’s relationship\nwith its customers and rewarding loyal customers in a strategic way. The team\nplans to maximize the potential of Optimizely’s Product Recommendations to\nprovide customers with data-backed recommendations both on its websites and\nemails.

In 1926, lifelong friends, John E. Behler and Wayne H.\nYoung founded a HVAC/R wholesale distribution business that did just that.\n\nThree generations later, Behler-Young has continued a commitment to the ethics,\nquality, excellence and teamwork that have characterized the company since its\ninception. Today, Behler-Young represents hundreds of manufacturers and serves\nthousands of customers throughout Michigan and Northwest Ohio with 18 branches\nand a 140,000 square foot distribution center in Kensington Park, Michigan.\n\nBehler-Young strives to be the highest value provider of HVAC/R products and\nservices in its market. To do this, the company centers its attention on its\ncustomers, promising the highest quality service possible. In its 90 year\nhistory, Behler-Young’s missions and values haven’t changed, but technology and\ncustomer expectations have.\n\nWe were not looking to conform to a rigid eCommerce box. The Optimizely B2B\nCommerce solution can be customized for our needs.\n\nKari Schellie\n\nSenior Marketing Manager , Behler Young\n\n## Pushing the envelope of digital transformation\n\nWithin the HVAC/R industry, companies are fairly traditional and often view\neCommerce as an unnecessary or even burdensome change. But Behler-Young is no\nstranger to breaking out of stagnation. Though there were not a lot of lookalike\ndistribution companies to reference as it underwent digital transformation,\nBehler-Young took the initiative and ventured into eCommerce.\n\nGiven its limited footprint, generating leads and new business was a challenge\nfor Behler-Young, but the main priority for digital transformation was always\nabout making it easier for Behler-Young customers to do their jobs.\n\n## From a limited experience to a fully integrated, seamless one\n\nWhen Behler-Young initially launched its eCommerce journey, the company utilized\nInfor Storefront for basic eCommerce, Billtrust for invoicing, a separate\ncontent marketing site and a mobile application. But none of the tools were\nintegrated which caused customer friction instead of customer enablement. As a\nresult, customers weren’t adopting digital.\n\nTraditionally, customers called to pay their invoices or check their order\nstatus, which limited Behler-Young’s team and prevented its customers from being\nself-sufficient. Behler-Young wanted to give their customers the tools to be\nable to service themselves online.\n\nBehler-Young envisioned a world where customers could pay their invoices, view\ntheir history and place their orders all in the same space. A seamless user\nexperience – not a disjointed one. Just as John and Wayne had a vision when they\nlaunched the company, Behler-Young’s digital marketing team had a vision for an\neven stronger future.\n\n## Executing a vision for a stronger future\n\nBehler-Young wanted a solution that would merge the digital experiences\ntogether, while better enabling its customers to do business with the company.\n\nIn addition, the new solution would need to integrate with the Infor A+ ERP to\nreflect all the processes onto the site. If the solution couldn’t do that, the\nrest of the technology wouldn’t have mattered.\n\nBehler-Young also recognized the importance of features like search, account\ninformation, marketing and promotions when they set out to find the right\nsolution for the business.\n\nBehler-Young found their solution in Optimizely’s B2B Commerce Cloud.\n\n## The new world with Optimizely\n\nToday, a Behler-Young customer can order products, create lists, cross reference\ntheir order history with their invoices and register for training in the same\nplace.\n\nCross-functional interaction between the technology systems is finally a\nreality. Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud easily integrated with all of Behler-\nYoung’s tools.\n\nBehler-Young is working with its customers to continuously grow and improve\ntheir site. The company has set aggressive goals to increase sales and gross\nprofit.\n\nOptimizely is proud to partner with a company that is future-proofing its\nbusiness. It’s clear that the team at Behler-Young recognizes its strong roots\nthat were planted over 90 years ago, and knows how to innovate and transform, so\nthey may serve its customers for the next 90 years.\n\nThat’s a heritage to celebrate.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://behler-young.com/",

Every customer is different, and they need to be treated as such\nif they are going to stick around.“Consumers expect to be recognized across\ndevices, whether that’s on the web or apps,” said Veronica Saha, Head of\nAnalytics at Zoopla.\n\n“They also expect to be able to interact 24/7, whenever it best suits them.\nBrands that are already doing this well have raised the level of expectation\namong consumers.\"\n\nPersonalization, according to Veronica, is all about enhancing user experiences\nand creating a better customer experience. This, then, has an immediate impact\non retention and acquisition costs. “If you have a good retention rate, then you\ndon’t have to work as hard to acquire customers over and over again,” she said.\n\n“Positive brand interactions create a flywheel—when you give your customers a\ngreat experience, they’ll come back for more and you’ll get to understand them\nbetter. This customer data then allows you to build more relevant experiences.”\n\n## **Unlocking customer insights with a smarter, integrated tech stack**\n\nHaving been with Zoopla for over six years, Veronica has seen the company\ndevelop and is now focused on the next phase of its analytics evolution. After\nspending the last several years constructing Zoopla's analytics infrastructure,\nher team was now able to utilize data for personalization.\n\n“To do this, we’ve implemented platforms like and Contentsquare,” shared\nVeronica. “Both platforms allow us to personalize our digital journey, making\nthe experience intuitive, simple and clear so users can move through our portal\nseamlessly.”\n\nWith seamless integration between and Contentsquare, digital teams across Zoopla\nwere able to easily uncover unique customer insights and then experiment with\ndifferent personalization strategies to find the one that works best for its\ncustomers. “The integration gives everyone across our digital teams access to\nquick insights,” Veronica added.\n\nBesides providing quick access to insights, the integration allowed analysts,\nproduct owners and designers at Zoopla to be more efficient. “Without a\ncomplicated data process, our people can focus on the job they need to get done,\nfreeing up time for brainstorming and creating hypotheses,” explained Veronica.\n\n## **A more refined approach to personalization**\n\nZoopla built its personalization strategy based on four main pillars: data,\njourney mapping, experimentation and automation.\n\nTechnology was the foundation of each pillar, enabling her team to build a solid\ngroundwork for personalization and smoothly implement its strategy. “Our\nanalytics stack is really important because it helps us segment and personalize\nthe entire journey across devices and platforms,” shared Veronica.\n\n\\_\\_\n\n_The four pillars of Zoopla’s personalization strategy_\n\n### **_Pillar 1: Data_**\n\nThe first step for Zoopla was to provide clarity on how they gather and use\nconsumer information. “In a cookieless world, first-party data is becoming more\nand more important,” explained Veronica. “So we’re focused on building trust and\nbeing transparent about how that data is used.”\n\n### **_Pillar 2: Journey Mapping_**\n\nVeronica knew that it could be difficult to personalize every touchpoint in the\ncustomer journey. “As much as we want to, we can’t tailor every single\ninteraction on the website,” she explained.\n\n“So we try to be extremely deliberate when applying personalization—only using\nit where it makes sense for the customer, to enhance their experience and\nstrengthen their relationship with Zoopla.”\n\nHer team achieved this with journey mapping, which enabled them to understand\nwhere to focus its personalization efforts, what the best action for the\ncustomer is, and how to align its product roadmaps with what its customers truly\nwant and need.\n\nBy leveraging segments within Contentsquare’s Customer Journey Analysis module\nto facilitate this process, the team was able to easily find out where buyers\nare in their journey—whether someone is just browsing or ready to apply for a\nmortgage—which gave them a comprehensive, single view of the customer.\n\n### **_Pillar 3: Experimentation_**\n\nAt Zoopla, testing is at the heart of personalization. Veronica and her team\nhave established a culture of experimentation and use a test-and-learn method to\ncontinuously deliver the best possible digital experience for users.\n\nAll this was made possible with the repository of user data from its improved\nanalytics stack, which helped the team gain a deeper understanding of its\ncustomers’ digital journeys and usage across devices. As a result, they could\ncreate more impactful hypotheses to guide its experimentation and optimization\nefforts on Optimizely.\n\n“Experimentation helps us improve both our products and services,” said\nVeronica. “Hypothesis testing has been built into",

To bring its strategy to fruition, it\nwas necessary to connect Zoopla's portal to its other platforms, such as email.\n\n“The three other pillars wouldn’t deliver value without automated workflows,\nlike APIs where you take all this customer intelligence and deploy it to your\ndigital channels,” said Veronica.\n\n## **Ambitious plans for future growth**\n\nFor Veronica, while this digital initiative has been a huge success, upgrading\nZoopla’s analytics capabilities was just the start of its personalization\nadventure. “It’s one thing to run a small experiment or introduce\npersonalization, but we need to learn how to use data in better ways, like with\nmachine learning,” she said.\n\n“Now that we have our technical set-up in place, we’re focused on analyzing,\niterating and testing—because like with anything, it’s unlikely you’ll get it\nright the first time around. For our personalization strategy to be truly\nsuccessful, we need to go back and continuously test.”\n\nThe next stage for Zoopla also involves extending personalization and\nexperimentation to all of its digital platforms. “We’re looking to scale\npersonalization so that we could, for example, take proprietary information such\nas postcode data to make the user journey more intuitive.”\n\nProduct managers and designers can experiment using Optimizely and Contentsquare\nwithout needing support from data analysts. They’re able to self-serve; if they\nhave an idea, they can test it themselves.\n\nVeronica Saha\n\nHead of Analytics, Zoopla\n\n## In collaboration with\n\n### Contentsquare\n\nContentsquare empowers brands to build better digital experiences.

But few of them infuse their mission and\nvalues into every aspect of their business. Eastern Industrial Supplies is one\nof those rare few.\n\nFor nearly 40 years, Eastern Industrial Supplies has been driven by the missions\nof caring for their employees, serving their customers with respect and\nintegrity and spreading positivity to their community, their country and the\nworld. These missions are engrained in the way Eastern serves their customers\nthroughout the United States.\n\nAs a traditional wholesale distributor of industrial pipe, valves, fittings,\nmechanical supplies, commercial plumbing, and engineered products, Eastern knows\nthat providing customers with the material and services they need contributes to\nthe development of communities locally and abroad. Extensive inventory,\nknowledgeable associates and the willingness to go the extra mile is what\nEastern customers expect, and that’s why they keep coming back.\n\nEastern’s focus on their people has never changed. But technology and customer\nexpectations have. Customers began looking for easier ways to buy. Competitors\nbuilt eCommerce programs. Younger generations were entering the workforce. In\norder to enable customers and employees to be more efficient, streamline\nprocesses and grow the business, Eastern ventured into eCommerce.\n\n## Eastern’s eCommerce requirements\n\nEastern looked for a deeply integrated, B2B solution that met specific\nrequirements including:\n\n- Tight integration with Eastern’s Eclipse ERP\n- Intuitive, user friendly platform\n- Mobile app\n- Complex product management and configuration\n- Customer specific catalog and experience\n- Multi-site capabilities\n- Promotions and merchandising functionality\n- Approval workflows, SEO and marketing\n- Shipping integration\n- Shipping management\n- Cloud solution\n- PunchOut capabilities\n- Request for quote functionality\n\nI like to use a car analogy. One platform reminded me of a Camry – it was very\nfunctional and dependable. But the other [Episerver B2B Commerce Cloyd by\nInsite] reminded me of a Lexus. It had all the functionality and dependability\nof the other platform, plus all the bells and whistles. All in a package that is\nmore intuitive and allows us to better serve our customers.\n\nDennis Karpinski\n\nDirector of eCommerce & Business Analysis, Eastern Industrial Supplies\n\n## Eastern’s new world with Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud by Insite\n\nIn July 2019, Eastern launched its eCommerce website with Optimizely B2B\nCommerce Cloud. Their solution is focused on providing customer specific\npricing, punchout capabilities, stock availability, order management, bar code\nenabled search, and quick access to enriched product content; all available 24/7\nfrom customers’ desktop or mobile devices.\n\nEastern was able to easily customize the Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud to\naccommodate their unique transaction flows and exceed customer expectations. The\nwebsite makes it easier for both employees and customers to do their jobs.\n\nEastern employees spend less time taking calls for inventory, invoices, or price\nquotes and more time on fostering deeper relationships. As Optimizely B2B\nCommerce Cloud frees them from the mundane and repetitive tasks, they are able\nto leverage their knowledge to solve customer problems and win more business.\n\nEastern has seen an early increase in site traffic, self-service events and\norders placed after initially submitting a request for quote. Just 2 months\nafter go-live, Eastern was seeing more than 9,500 monthly page views, more than\n1,200 self-service events and more than 3,000 mobile events.\n\nEastern continues to enhance and improve the customer experience. No matter what\nchanges, one thing is certain: Eastern will do everything in their power to make\nsure their customers are always happy.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.easternfirst.com/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nXNGAGE\n\nXNGAGE is a Digital Services firm focused on delivering Commerce Success in B2B\nfor leading manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers.",

Van Meter focuses on creating lasting\nvalue for the customers and partners they serve, a commitment that has been\nengrained in the company since its earliest years – and one that helped them\nthrive even through the Great Depression.\n\n100 percent employee-owned, Van Meter represents more than 800 brands in the\nelectrical, automation and mechanical industries, with 16 branches in the\nMidwest and plans for further expansion.\n\nUnderlying Van Meter’s commitment to service is the team’s relentless spirit of\ninnovation and vision for growth. In order to continue innovating and growing,\nVan Meter set out to be a better digital partner to their customers and serve\nthem in more meaningful ways.\n\nOur customers expect the same level of sophistication and convenience from a B2B\necommerce experience that they enjoy when shopping in the B2C world. Our\npartnership with Episerver has allowed us to make great strides in offering that\nkind of experience on vanmeterinc.com\n\nKarmen Wilhelm\n\nVice President of Marketing, Van Meter\n\n## From basic online ordering to a fully integrated, best-in-class digital\n\nexperience\n\nAs a leader and innovator in the industry, Van Meter was early to adopt a web\norder entry tool, built by their ERP provider, in the mid 2000s. In 2014, Van\nMeter built a more robust ecommerce site and completed a subsequent redesign in 2016.\n\nBy 2018, Van Meter recognized the site had become fairly stagnant. Customer\nadoption had plateaued, sales weren’t improving and the site was not built to\nscale.\n\nSimple edits or customizations weren’t possible, or if they were, took far too\nlong to keep up with Van Meter’s desired pace. Their team didn’t have control\nover even small edits to the platform. Additionally, the CMS was essentially\nnon-existent. As a result, Van Meter had to leverage two separate systems to\npiece their commerce and marketing content together. It became apparent that a\nnew technology solution was needed.\n\nVan Meter’s vision was to get beyond web order. They didn’t want a partner that\ncould help them with basic online transactions, they wanted a partner that could\nenable them to completely overhaul their digital customer experience and add\ntrue business value.\n\n## B2B ecommerce as the catalyst for growth\n\nVan Meter wanted their ecommerce site to be a growth engine, one that could\ndrive revenue for the company. In a perfect world, at least 10 percent of\noverall sales would go through the website by 2025. In order to reach that goal,\nVan Meter needed organizational buy-in and change.\n\nAs they searched for the right ecommerce solution for the paradigm shift, Van\nMeter conducted vast internal and external research. Van Meter gained an\nunderstanding of where they were and where they wanted to be and incorporated\ninsights and feedback direct from their customers. As they continued their\nresearch and started identifying suitable platforms, they came across\nOptimizely.\n\nOptimizely was able to provide a robust B2B ecommerce assessment that helped Van\nMeter understand their requirements. Some of the requirements at the top of\ntheir list included:\n\n• Integration with their Epicor Eclipse ERP and other backend systems• Customer\nportal• Customization capabilities• Guest checkout• Credit card/payment methods•\nCustomer support• Strong implementation partner network• CMS to manage marketing\ncontent alongside ecommerce• Out-of-the-box SEO capabilities• Strong\nunderstanding of key groups like AD and IDEA\n\n## Early results despite a launch at the height of a global pandemic\n\nVan Meter launched their new site powered by Optimizely in June 2020, at the\nheight of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOptimizely’s partner, Xngage was top notch throughout the implementation of B2B\nCommerce Cloud. Their experience, expertise and knowledge of the Epicor ERP\nsystem helped make the integration process very smooth. The site was up and\nrunning in just over eight months.\n\nEven through change and disruption, Van Meter’s results tell a powerful story.\n\nAs Van Meter grows into new markets, they are now able to garner more sales with\nfewer people resources. By moving some of the service-based activities online,\nsalespeople are able to focus on higher value tasks and let the ecommerce site\nwork 24/7. Customers can seamlessly serve themselves online to access order\nhistory, checkout and view account information.\n\nIn just six months time, Van Meter has seen incredible business value by\npartnering with Optimizely.\n\nCustomers were quick to adopt the platform. In fact, in the first quarter live,\nVan Meter saw the number of active accounts more than double. The percent of\nactive accounts, or digitally engaged customers, climbed to 60% from 25% year-\nover-year.\n\nVan Meter’s site has also attracted new customers. In just six months, Van Meter\nadded 62 net new, online only accounts. Many of those customers went on to apply\nfor business accounts with Van Meter, an avenue that was not available to\ncustomers prior to the new site going live.\n\nAdditionally, Van Meter is expanding to new markets. Between guest orders and\nnet new accounts, the website helped Van Meter sell into 12 states, something\nthat was not possible with the previous site.\n\nIn Q3 of 2020, online order frequency increased by 23% year-over-year.

    "content": "# SRA implements change control and content approvals\n\nSolicitors Regulation Authority partners with Optimizely to help empower public\nlegal education at scale.\n\n## The SRA partners with Optimizely to help solve its digital challenges\n\nThe Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) regulates solicitors and law firms in\nEngland and Wales. Its purpose is to protect the public by making sure that\nsolicitors meet high standards. The SRA is responsible for regulating the\nprofessional conduct of more than 200,000 solicitors. They regulate 10,000 law\nfirms, as well as thousands of individuals working in-house at private and\npublic sector organizations.\n\n## Making services accessible to all\n\nThe SRA team needed to provide accurate, timely information to a large cohort of\ndependents across its digital platforms. The previous platform was buried in\ncode, and in a separate tool that couldn’t be accessed in a timely fashion. This\nrisked the SRA not being as responsive to the dynamic customer as they wanted to\nbe.\n\nThe content needed to be relevant and valuable for a range of digital users and\nspeak to different audiences, from legal professionals to the general public\nseeking legal information and advice. Because of the nature of SRA’s services,\nthe regulator holds classified information and sensitive personal information,\nso having a secure CMS was also a requirement for the business.\n\nUsers ranged from members of the public searching for legal services through to\nprofessional global law firms. It was essential the SRA were able to delicately\nmanage the balance between the various groups they serviced online quickly and\nefficiently. What was the same across all segments of users was the expectation\nthat the SRA delivered a trusted virtual service.\n\nThere is significant responsibility placed on the organization given they are\nthe body that regulates the qualification process of solicitors. They also had\nto make sure they were delivering public legal education to users of legal\nservices.\n\n## Meeting the needs of an array of digital users\n\nThe SRA’s services are used by hundreds of thousands of people a year, so they\nneeded to deliver relevant, targeted content at scale. They had identified key\nmilestones:\n\n- Authentication on website\n- Personalization of content offer\n- Integration of content and transaction\n\nAt the core of every good experience is strong content, and Optimizely’s Content\nCloud offered major advantages for the project. Content Cloud gave the SRA the\ntools to create compelling content experiences for its visitors. The system\nempowered editors to create and combine content assets to create a cross section\nof content to suit those looking for easy-to-digest content and those requiring\nmore detailed information around regulation and compliance. Some of the wording\non the SRA’s website is detailed and tricky, even for law professionals to\nunderstand.\n\nOptimizely’s CMS, with workflow built in, gave the SRA the opportunity to\nimplement change control and content approval, guaranteeing the right level of\ngovernance for changes to the content of questions that tens of thousands of\nsolicitors are going to answer.\n\nAnother key consideration was to produce a platform that helped the organization\nmeet its security requirements. Optimizely Content Cloud requires authentication\non the content website, helping to meet security requirements and allowing the\ndelivery of personalized content.\n\nThe SRA holds a large volume of information about firms and individuals they\nregulate. This information has the potential to drive ever more personalized\nexperiences of the content and products on their website, such as the\n‘Solicitors Register.’\n\n## The results\n\nWorking with Optimizely, the SRA was able to tackle its digital challenges by\nkeeping its content safe and managed with governance, reporting and controls\nthat enabled improved user journeys. A content-driven website that not only\nprovides information first-hand for its users but is also an authoritative\nsource of information that includes attributes of the service, regulatory\nstatus, regulatory record and more, was created and all managed on one secure\nplatform.\n\nThe SRA sees major benefits in managing transactional content – both\nmicrocontent and contextual help – through the Optimizely CMS rather than\nsifting through code. The quality of the customer offer is enhanced, while the\nstrain placed on the business through needless inbound contact is reduced.\n\nFor the SRA, demonstrating value with their digital estate is not counting cash\nto prove ROI. It is about demonstrating value for money. With Optimizely, the\nSRA team is framing their offer in very real, relatable terms.\n\n#### Industry\n\nTech\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.sra.org.uk/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\ndotcentric Limited\n\ndotcentric - a leading Optimizely agency driving commercial success through\ncreativity, strategy, user experience and technical know-how.",

This growth is the beginning of a\njourney, and Optimizely is making it easier for CASETiFY to take the right path.\n\nLike many other growing businesses, CASETiFY was focused on optimizing\nconversion rates, and using experimentation to understand more about their\ncustomers.\n\nStarting with more basic tools, Beatrix Wong, Head of Ecommerce, quickly\nrealized this wasn’t working for CASETiFY. “The basic tools on the market didn’t\nreally work for us – they were difficult to use, and we had to assign a senior\nprogrammer to run tests and mapping data was slow and inaccurate.”\n\nWong and her team wanted to conduct five to six experiments per week but\ncombined with the daily high traffic, they immediately realized that a superior\nexperimentation tool was needed.\n\nWe want to focus on optimizing our mobile app and engage with our customers\nthere, so their experience is optimized however they want to engage with us. We\nseek to give our customers the same excellent service and experience on mobile,\nas well as on the website. Optimizely Intelligence Cloud allows us to launch\nsophisticated experiments that are easy to create and manage for those with no\ntechnical background. This empowers not only my team, but is easy to understand\nfor everyone, and creates a culture of experimentation for all of us.\n\nBeatrix Wong\n\nHead of Ecommerce, CASETiFY\n\n## Creating the right solution\n\nFinding the right solution was important for Wong and her team – the previous\nexperience had been time consuming, and they couldn’t trust the results.\n\n“We wanted an experimentation tool that was sophisticated enough for us to test\nacross all customer touchpoints. But it should also be easy for my team and I to\nrun tests without the need to have technical knowledge,” said Wong. “Based on\nour research and the recommendations we received, I was convinced that\nOptimizely Intelligence Cloud was the right solution.”\n\nWhen CASETiFY began its experimentation journey with Optimizely’s server-side\nexperimentation solution, one by one, the challenges they faced before were\neliminated.\n\nBy operating on Optimizely Intelligence Cloud, Wong and her team can now focus\non more impactful work. The team no longer needs to cross-check data for\naccuracy, as there is integration between CASETiFY’s database and Optimizely\nIntelligence Cloud.\n\nWong added, “Due to the ease of use, now my team and I are empowered to run\ntests on our own, and I believe that we’re able to operate at least 50% more\nefficiently than before.”\n\n## Data-driven improvement through experimentation\n\nExperimentation has now become the core of CASETiFY’s business, to continue to\nimprove digital experience as the customer base grows.\n\n“Experimentation has never been a one-off initiative - we run tests all the\ntime. With Optimizely Intelligence Cloud there is zero latency, so we know the\nresults of tests as they happen. During this time of growth and changing\ncustomer profiles, we need to be in tune with our customers to create the best\nexperiences,” said Wong.\n\nThe culture of experimentation has also created a data-driven approach for the\nwider team at CASETiFY when making business decisions. Market expansion is less\nrisky when decisions are based on fully understanding customer behavior, rather\nthan guesswork.\n\nThe power of experimentation has allowed CASETiFY to improve as a business\nconsistently – from customer experience and product development to localization\nstrategy.\n\nCASETiFY.com has been the go-to platform for customers; however, Wong and her\nteam are excited to engage with their customers on their latest mobile app,\nCASETiFY Colab.\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.casetify.com/",

They dreamed of\ngiving customers access to affordable products and helping food industry\nsuppliers increase their sales.\n\n60 years and three generations of Tracy family leaders later, Dot Foods has\ntransformed the food industry and is the largest food industry redistribution\ncompany in North America.\n\nDot Foods owes its success to their business model, shared values, the talents\nof 6,400 employees and the Tracy family’s leadership. Dot Foods is considered a\nB2B food service leader and serves as a much-needed “buy by the truck-load”\nfood-supply partner sitting in between food manufacturers like P&G, Kellogg’s,\nGeneral Mills, etc. and consumer channels.\n\nToday, Dot Foods makes more products accessible to more people than ever before\nand is hyper-focused on driving growth. To differentiate, Dot Foods looked to\nembark on a digital transformation journey and own their entire distribution\nnetwork. Dot Foods partnered with Optimizely and Valtech to engineer new\nexperiences for the end-user that would change the way the promise of shared\ngrowth was delivered to their customers.\n\n## From simple transactions to customer-centric experiences\n\nDot Foods’ initial ecommerce portal was a simple transactional site. Dot Foods\nknew that in order to transform, they had to change their focus to putting the\ncustomer at the center of the experience. Dot Foods wanted to serve their\ncustomers in more meaningful ways online by being more transparent, proactive\nand anticipating their needs.

The on-premise hosted, IT-owned\nand managed website had restricted internal access, making it difficult for the\nmarketing team to deliver updates to customers in an agile manner. With the\norganization growing rapidly, Global Credit Union needed a secure site that\nhelped streamline internal workflows and approvals—without increasing the burden\non IT.\n\nThe team was also aware of the importance of communicating Global Credit Union’s\nwider presence to prospects through geo-targeted content to dispel the\nimpression of being an Alaska-exclusive organization, despite its operating\nthroughout the western United States—something the previous infrastructure could\nnot support.\n\n## Overhauling Global Credit Union’s digital experience, inside out\n\nGlobal Credit Union surveyed and evaluated several top-tier CMS providers,\nincluding Sitecore and Adobe. The strategic acquisitions made by Optimizely to\nenhance customers’ DXP capabilities solidified Resh’s confidence in Optimizely’s\ncapabilities and future as a holistic digital solutions provider, a key reason\nfor the decision to renew with Optimizely.\n\nGlobal Credit Union partnered with Extractable as the project’s implementation\npartner for their expertise in user experience and digital strategy specific to\nthe financial industry.\n\nExtractable drove the content strategy and implementation on the Optimizely DXP\nwhile working closely with the Global Credit Union team to ensure seamless and\nsecure integrations with internal systems.\n\nResh shared that the marketing team now maintains full ownership of the site,\nallowing numerous content authors, reviewers, and publishers to expedite content\nupdates and approvals. With Optimizely’s ability to support multiple authors\nwith varying permission levels, the team is empowered to deliver content in a\ntimely fashion, supporting the organization’s goal for growth.\n\nIn addition, Extractable also kicked off Global Credit Union’s personalization\nand analytics roadmap by segmenting visitors into groups and setting up\nanalytics dashboards that help the team gain a holistic understanding of site\nvisitors and behavior using Optimizely’s AI-powered Recommendations.\n\nThe team leverages Recommendation’s Targeting and Visitor Groups to deliver geo-\npersonalized messaging to site visitors supporting Global Credit Union’s quest\nfor growth across the west coast and Arizonan markets by showcasing content that\nspeaks to their individual communities.\n\nGlobal Credit Union’s marketing team is building on the foundation that\nExtractable laid in Content Management’s Targeting to go one layer deeper and\ndeliver personalized content based on previous site interactions.\n\nWith a strong foundation laid out for its website, it was important for Global\nCredit Union to ensure that future decisions were based on real user feedback\nand data. The addition of Optimizely Web Experimentation allows the team to make\ndata-informed decisions instead of relying on industry best practices,\nintuitional knowledge, and anecdotal feedback while evaluating future changes\nand enhancements.\n\n“I have found the platform to be scalable and easy to use. Optimizely’s roadmap\nand recent acquisitions have demonstrated that they’re serious about creating a\ntruly robust DXP solution. I’m excited to be working with Optimizely because\nit's not just about websites anymore.”\n\nHeather Resh\n\nMarketing Operations Manager, Global Credit Union\n\n## The member-centric improvements pay off\n\nGlobal Credit Union experienced immediate benefits relaunching its site on\nOptimizely’s industry-leading digital solution. Extractable’s effective setup of\nanalytics monitoring enabled Global Credit Union to harness data, including\ntraffic source and user engagement information, to gain a holistic understanding\nof site visitors and behavior.\n\nResh shared that overall engagement increased by 20% since launching the site in\nOctober 2022. This success is attributed to the increase in published content\nand addition of interactive tools, providing site visitors with more reasons to\nengage. Further, with Optimizely’s intuitive interface, the Global Credit Union\nteam now publishes a minimum of two to three new financial wellness articles in\na month, consistently and with ease, further engaging return visitors.\n\nThe team also shared they have measured a significant decrease in overall bounce\nrate, a 10% increase in sessions originating from organic search, and have\nincreased traffic to several key product pages by over 50%.\n\nGlobal Credit Union has also received compliments from its members about the\nsecurity upgrades launched with the new site.\n\nResh believes the partnerships with Optimizely and Extractable have helped to\neliminate some of the technical debts Global Credit Union accumulated and\nempowers the organization to deliver modern digital experiences that members\nexpect from their financial institutions.\n\nThe new Global Credit Union site scales with the company’s growth and puts it on\nthe right track to increase membership.\n\n##",

The influx on the\nexisting on-premise infrastructure could not withstand causing latency and\ncrashes. FL DEM needed a cloud-based solution fast, escalating the issue all the\nway to the governor’s office.\n\n## A Cloud-first strategy to facilitate a communicative, digital ecosystem for\n\nall residents\n\nThe Optimizely Digital Experience Platform was the cloud-first solution FL DEM\nneeded, providing high availability and performance, easy connectivity with\nother cloud services and existing systems, and the ability to manage drastic\nchanges in traffic. Optimizely, along with FL DEM’s web partners **Blend\nInteractive** and **AAJ Computer Services, Inc dba OZ** , were able to\ncommunicate the need for a Digital Experience Platform and execute an agreement\nin less than three days proving, together, the collaborative team could support\ntheir needs from an IT, security, and reliability perspective.\n\nThe implementation of Content Cloud highlights the benefit of cloud-based vs an\ninstance-bound subscription license, with the need expanding beyond COVID-19,\npreparing them for the spikes in traffic that occur throughout hurricane season\nas well. The Cloud infrastructure, built on Microsoft Azure, means the site\nisn't prone to downtime, especially during critical periods.\n\nThere were a lot of moving parts to work within a short amount of time,\nbalancing procurement, partnership, and implementation processes.

For this project, the goal\nwas supporting the customer and working with them to execute and have their\nenvironment provisioned in less than 24 hours from receiving an executed\ncontract.\n\nBecause of Blend's expansive experience working with Optimizely, they were able\nto help articulate the value of DXP and collaborate with the client's internal\ndevelopment and IT teams for a seamless transition to the platform.\n\n#### Industry\n\nEducation\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

The company is focused on redefining storage, helping customers\nshift—operationally and culturally—the way they purchase and consume storage for\nbreakthrough innovation and scale.\n\nIn early 2020 the Content Studio leader, Lisa Oda, was focused on a journey of\ntransformation to create efficiencies around website, collateral and brand\ncontent production. At the same time, there was a vision to develop high-value\ncontent—thought leadership—for awareness and increased share of voice.\n\nWith only a few team members in place (two writers and one SEO manager), Oda\nrecognized they’d need to bring more of the content production in-house — and\nfast. “In order to keep up with the demands of the business, we needed to scale\nthe team with experts,” said Oda. “We needed people who knew content development\nand our business to help us produce quality content within tight timelines.”\n\nBut it wasn’t enough just to hire the team—Pure Storage would also need the\nright tools to enable them to execute.\n\nHer vision? Marketing transformation to structure process—and incoming data—to\nsave time so the team could elevate thought leadership content. “I wanted to\nimplement a system to help standardize and structure content requests. The goal:\nTo break down silos and create a “freeway” through the organization coupled with\nrepeatable processes for ease-of-use and efficiency.”\n\nWhat we found along the way was that incoming requests were unstructured,\nmissing key information, or not easy to understand. It required multiple\nmeetings with stakeholders to gather the data, and in some cases created\nconfusion about process flow, review, and approvals. In addition, much of the\nwork was handled offline, with key details locked in documents no one could find\nor access.\n\nLisa Oda\n\nHead of content & SEO, Pure Storage\n\nIn 2020, the team selected Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform (CMP) to\nhelp:\n\n1. ### Centralize (and accelerate) the intake of content requests.\n\n   “With 100+ requests coming in from around the globe every single month — from\n   internal marketing to marketing partners to product — the types of content\n   requests we received ran the gamut,” said Oda. “Our previous free-form intake\n   left a lot to be desired. We were often missing key information, which slowed\n   down our execution… and raised stress levels.”After auditing and categorizing\n   the types of requests they would receive most often, the Pure Storage team used\n   CMP to build a set of intake forms. Every request that came in would be\n   perfectly structured, complete with all the information Oda’s team would need to\n   execute immediately (without more back-and-forth).\n\n2. ### Standardize (and streamline) the execution of content creation/reviews.\n\n   With all of those requests coming in, the team built specific workflows for all\n   of the most common content and creative requests — whether it was a blog post, a\n   thought leadership piece, technical web content, or another type of request.“It\n   was a very data-driven approach,” said Oda. “We assessed everything: where the\n   work should start; who needs to be involved; who is the final approver; how much\n   time each person needs to complete their part; where the final assets need to\n   go. We now know exactly what needs to be done and can easily forecast when\n   projects will be complete.”\n\n3. ### Build key integrations to distribute and measure the value of content.\n   The final piece was making sure that the CMP was fully integrated with key tools\n   of the Pure Storage marketing stack — including Bynder to store assets, as well\n   as Marketo and Salesforce to provide critical engagement and ROI analytics.\n\n## **Results to date**\n\nToday, the Pure Storage team’s work isn’t just centralized on Optimizely's CMP.\nThey’ve orchestrated a full, end-to-end lifecycle of content and creative\ndelivery — from intake to production through distribution and ultimately\nmeasurement.\n\nAs pleased as the team is with its ability to transform the organization into a\ncontent machine, the benefits go beyond the tactical efficiency gains.\n\nAnd perhaps most importantly, Optimizely's CMP has enabled Oda and team to\nchange the conversation internally.\n\n“For us, it was important to be able to speak from a results perspective. How\nmuch are we producing, how are we supporting the business, and what’s the impact\nof that work against the goal of moving prospects through the funnel,” said Oda.\n“We’re well on our way.”\n\nContent marketing transformation went from vision to reality through the\npartnership with Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform. It all started with a\ngoal to structure processes — and incoming data — through end-to-end\norchestration and has led to more time for more strategic work.

Valtech has been a strategic partner\nof Optimizely for over 20 years, delivering over 350 implementations of\nOptimizely's suite of products.\n\nAs a partner, Valtech has helped many clients achieve their digital goals with\nOptimizely One. As a customer, Valtech has capitalized on Optimizely's products\nto power its own marketing operations and create a seamless and cohesive\nexperience across all touchpoints. This was no easy feat after having acquired\neight companies in 2022, and needing to reconcile the different processes, tools\nand branding that came with their expansion.\n\n## Keeping up with a growing and complex marketing organization\n\nPrior to 2020, Valtech's marketing team was using several different tools to\nmanage their overall marketing orchestration strategy. They were able to make\nsome of the processes work with what they had, but once their organization\nexpanded, they quickly realized that the way they were managing their work\nwasn’t scalable or efficient. For example, they were taking a templatized\napproach for overall marketing activities, but had no functionality to support\nautomated workflows, which meant that once the template was completed,\ncollaboration had to happen over email or a chat message.\n\nIt’s no surprise that this process led to challenges in execution, making it\ndifficult to break silos between different markets and teams, ensure brand\nconsistency and quality across all channels and formats, and provide\nstakeholders with complete visibility of what was happening, when.\n\nThese challenges were ultimately keeping Valtech from being able to meet their\ngoals of long-term brand building, short term activation and focusing on return\non investment (ROI). They needed a tool that could help them overcome these\nchallenges and enable them to work more efficiently and effectively as a\nmarketing team.\n\n## Shifting from customer implementations to their own\n\nAs a long-time partner of Optimizely, Valtech decided to treat themselves as a\nclient and implement Optimizely Content Marketing Platform (CMP) as its\nmarketing orchestration and content supply tool. Purpose-built for marketers,\nwhich was a big selling point for Valtech, Optimizely CMP enables marketers to\nplan, create, collaborate, store and publish content—all in one place.\n\nI didn't want to end up a tool where I had to have specialists somewhere that\ndoing everything for me. I wanted a tool for marketing, for the marketing\npeople, in the marketing department. That was super important.\n\nMattias Malmer\n\nGlobal Head of Marketing, Valtech\n\nAlong with its user-friendly interface, Valtech chose CMP for its powerful\ncapabilities that solve for their specific use cases.\n\n## Use case 1: Unprecedented visibility\n\nAs a global and distributed company, Valtech’s marketing organization needs to\nhave complete visibility into what’s being planned for both long-term brand\nbuilding and short-term activation.\n\nValtech relies on CMP as their marketing system of record, using it to manage\nwork requests, plan and create content, and execute campaigns. “If it’s not in\nthe CMP, it doesn’t exist,” said Malmer.\n\nThe functionality of CMP means that every team can have their own calendar, but\nthey can also be aggregated too.\n\nThe board view in CMP serves as the basis of Valtech’s content stand ups, making\nit easy for their team to review what’s next, what’s in progress and what is\ncompleted.\n\nWhere they previously would have to create a deck to provide updates on what\nmarketing was working on, anyone in the organization can now have a\ncomprehensive view of planned marketing activities in the Calendar view.\n\nValtech also relies on the List view, which provides a spreadsheet-like\nexperience, to track global and local initiatives according to their\nverticalized industry approach.\n\n> “My list view is my source of truth for work that needs to get done. It’s\n> great that we can each have a dashboard that can adapt to our own individual\n> roles and needs.” - **Valtech employee and CMP user**.\n> Their ability to view marketing activities in different ways allows Valtech to\n> ensure stakeholder alignment, that all marketing activities ladder up to their\n> overall strategy and that everything is measured for ROI.\n\n## Use case 2: Increased efficiency\n\nValtech’s marketing organization relies on predefined project structures,\ntemplates and integrated workflows for efficient creation of all types of\ncontent, including campaigns, events, emails, articles and social media posts.\nRecenty Valtech elevated the use of the platform beyond just content creation\n(while content creation still being the main volume), making it a project\nmanagement tool for the whole marketing org.\n\nTo further accelerate their content workflows, Valtech leverages Opal,\nOptimizely’s AI assistant. They integrate Opal in a variety of ways, for example\nto elaborate on or refine content in just a few clicks, and to generate copy for\nsocial posts. As an innovative digital agency, Valtech is keen to take advantage\nof CMP’s AI and automation capabilities to enhance content quality and optimize\ntheir digital experiences",

Brand\nconsistency and stringent brand governance is not an easy task to master for an\nentire organization. I think a lot of big companies struggle with that as well.\nWe’re now able to have a control mechanism on brand consistency, tone of voice,\netc.\n\nMattias Malmer\n\nGlobal Head of Marketing, Valtech\n\n## Valtech transforms marketing processes to operate more efficiently\n\nSince implementing Optimizely CMP, Valtech has seen significant improvements in\nthe way their marketing team works and executes marketing projects, including a\nbig focus on content and campaigns. To illustrate this, in 2024 alone, CMP\nenabled their team to achieve the following:\n\n- **300+ content items** **were created for their website,** empowering their teams to consistently deliver engaging, high-quality digital experiences.\n- In their recent acquisition of Kin+Carta, CMP played a pivotal role in ensuring brand consistency, with **170+ content items brand-washed** as part of the migration process.\n- The team has successfully executed **200+ content-related projects** with nearly **900 tasks turned around** , showcasing their ability to efficiently manage complex initiatives.\n\nStakeholders have greater visibility into marketing activities, with shared\nboards, calendars and views for different geographic regions and verticals.\nThey’re able to execute with improved efficiency and predictability of marketing\ninitiatives, with clear ownership, and the ability to leverage AI to accelerate\ntheir workflows. With standardized templates and approvals, Valtech has also\nbeen able to better control their brand, ensuring content has consistent\nmessaging, visual identity and tone of voice.\n\nSpending less time on trying to make their disparate tools work for them,\nValtech has been able to shift their focus to ROI and outcomes of their content\nand campaigns they produce.\n\nValtech’s utilization of Optimizely’s CMP now extends outside the organization.\nFor instance, when Valtech acquires another company, the challenge of seamlessly\nmigrating all assets and tasks, including extensive website content, is a\ncritical task. Leveraging the CMP’s robust capabilities, Valtech can orchestrate\nthe transfer of all marketing assets with precision, ensuring a smooth\ntransition while maintaining brand integrity across all marketing activities.\n\nDuring a recent acquisition our team planned and mapped out months of work in\nCMP. When the work was done, we were all amazed at how precise the planning had\nbeen. We hit deadlines for complex, multi-stakeholder tasks that were set out.\nThere were all these moving pieces, but it all came together in the end, just as\nwe’d envisioned.\n\nEric Barrier\n\nGlobal Content Strategist, Valtech\n\n## Looking to the future\n\nValtech is always looking for new ways to innovate and transform its marketing\noperations. Their marketing team aims to showcase its full Optimizely One\necosystem— with Optimizely CMS, Web Experimentation, and CMP fully integrated—as\na reference case for its clients and prospects.\n\nValtech have just finalized upgrading from Optimizely CMS 11 to CMS 12 to\nleverage the newest features and capabilities. Next step is to explore\nimplementing the CMS+CMP Publishing Integration to help them streamline creating\ncontent for CMS by utilizing workflows in CMP.\n\nThey have piloted their instance with Marketo, their marketing automation tool,\nand have built out a Marketo template within CMP. When fully deployed, this will\nallow Valtech’s marketers to create emails that follow their standard template,\nwith the proper logo and footer, and preview how the email will look without\nleaving CMP. This means they can skip all the back and forth of approvals and\nedits that would normally have to be done by someone with access to Marketo,\nwhich significantly streamlines their email creation process.\n\nTo level up their usage of AI, Valtech is considering using the Bring Your Own\nAI feature in CMP, which enables users to connect their AI provider of choice to\nOpal, Optimizely’s AI assistant.

    "content": "# Material Handling Systems rolls out a new corporate website\n\nMHS launched a multi-brand global corporate website and an online parts catalog\nfor US customers using Optimizely’s Digital Experience Platform\n\n## Remaining competitive in a changing market\n\nMHS Global (MHS) is a full-service provider of innovative material handling\nsystems that solve the challenges of distribution and fulfilment operations. MHS\nhas a global installed base of over $5 billion for small to large distribution\nand fulfilment projects in a variety of industries, including e-commerce,\nparcel, third party logistics and outside integrators.\n\nMHS has grown organically and through acquisition bringing together multiple\nbrands that have strong reputations in different aspects of the material\nhandling systems industry. This resulted in several different web sites and\ndifferent platforms. MHS did not have an online presence for aftermarket parts\nsupport anywhere globally, instead supporting their customers via phone and\nemail and non-digital channels.\n\nTo remain competitive in the market, MHS set a strategy to create a new web\npresence that will support multiple brands in multiple countries along with an\naftermarket parts channel to better service existing and future clients. MHS\nchose Optimizely because the platform supports multiple brands, multiple\nlanguages and has strong content management, search and ecommerce capabilities\nin one platform.\n\nAs MHS grew through acquisitions it was important that our web presence\nreflected our new, full service capabilities. We needed a website that\ncommunicated who MHS is now. It was a large project with a strict deadline to go\nlive before our first ever tradeshow. Our new website is a great reflection of\nMHS now and looking toward the future. The design is modern and clean and the\nnavigation is easy to use. We have received many compliments on our site\n\nLauren Pedley\n\nSr. Marketing Analyst , MHS\n\n## Developing a digital approach\n\nWhen it came to objectives, MHS have a clear approach in order to achieve a\nstrong digital presence.\n\nThis meant developing a global web presence that told the combined story of MHS\nbut allowed different brands to shine. By developing a global digital\naftermarket parts channel to better service existing and future clients, they\ncould support parts ordering that meets the needs of B2B customer’s,\norganizational goals, and individual requirements.\n\nWith a clear approach, MHS desired a unified platform that supported multiple\nbrands and languages along with content management and commerce.\n\nMHS, along with its partner Rightpoint, determined a phased approach to\nlaunching a new online experience. The first phase was to rollout a new\ncorporate website. In choosing a platform, the team also considered the ultimate\ngoal of also developing an after-market parts channel\n\nThe new MHS website was launched on the Optimizely Content Cloud. Through\nfurther competitor research and strategic analysis, the team created a roadmap\nin July 2019 to deliver an MVP experience for the parts catalog, built upon the\nexisting corporate website using Optimizely Commerce Manager. In June 2020, MHS\nlaunched the first phase of the online parts catalog. Future phases to build out\nadditional ecommerce features are being evaluated and refined.\n\nMHS leveraged Optimizely's Digital Experience Platform as a platform-as-a-\nservice (PAAS) model to take advantage of the Microsoft Azure Cloud to reduce\ncomplexity and be able to scale cost effectively.\n\nAs the industry and MHS continue to evolve, MHS plans to implement more advanced\nB2B commerce features using AI and other tools to even better service customers\nand continue to fuel the growth by a desire to be the best, not the biggest.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.mhsglobal.com/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nRightpoint\n\nPremier Platinum Partner!

    "content": "# RSPB sees 43% increase in overall page visits\n\nCreating a seamless user experience with new digital eco-system, Europe's\nlargest wildlife conservation organization take flight on Optimizely\n\nThe RSPB is the UK’s largest nature conservation charity working to secure a\nhealthy environment for and to protect threatened birds and wildlife. Whilst the\nRSPB was already seen by the public as the champion of birdlife, it had a\ngreater ambition. To champion the cause of wildlife in general.\n\nTo achieve this they needed to extend the engagement of the charity’s existing\none million-plus supporters and bring in a new generation of conservation\nadvocates and donors online.\n\nThey embarked on a campaign to support this vision, and Optimizely’s partner\nZone were tasked with bringing this vision to life.\n\n## Pacing For Lift-off\n\nRSPB’s digital strategy was clear. They needed to rebuild their online presence\nand use a digital content solution to support and improve their vision of\nchampioning wildlife as a whole. RSPB started by rebuilding their website’s\n‘Give Nature a Home’ section. In anticipation of increased digital traffic\npushed by offline activities, Zone had to act fast to overhaul both this section\nof the website and the membership area and homepage – transitioning RSPB to\nOptimizely CMS in the process.\n\nThe website rebuild not only focussed on a striking visual design with a\nscalable video to engage the audience, but an improved smooth and seamless user\nexperience was forefront. A simpler layout was implemented to the pages and\nfocused on streamlining particular user journeys – for example a fractured and\nhighly complex membership sign-up path was simplified into a universal four-step\nprocess.\n\n## Flocking Together Through Social Engagement\n\nGlobal integration and localisation features were also introduced to the\nwebsite. The ‘Make a Home for Wildlife’ feature lets members of the social\ncommunity engage with other members as well as the charity itself. By sharing\nchanges members have made to their gardens to make a home for wildlife lets\nother members see what’s being done locally that they can learn from, whilst\npromoting a community spirit. Engaging its members in this way lets RSPB develop\na rapport between members and the brand, ultimately leading to increased and\nlong term donor support and loyalty.\n\n## Taking Flight\n\nThe new fully mobile responsive website was built using Optimizely with a number\nof features integrated to enable first time web visitors to move through to\nbecoming part of the social community and a donor:\n\nBuilt in Optimizely, the website features extensive use of inline (WYSISYG)\nediting and relies heavily on Optimizely’s drag & drop block functionality. It\nhas been built to be fully responsive, with ImageResizer to manage images and\nHTML5 enabling the fluid-width videos\n\nExtensive personalisation was key to the success of the project so Optimizely\nSearch & Navigation was implemented, working in conjunction with the Google API.\n\nTo build the social community and develop and encourage engagement, Stackla was\nused for social media aggregation and moderation\n\nIn the rebuild, it was essential to bring donors online so Authorise.Net was\nimplemented for payment processing\n\n## A New Formation\n\nSince launching the site, RSPB have seen an average increase in conversion of\nmemberships by 23% over the datum conversion rate.The new 'Give Nature A Home in\nyour garden' section has had a 42% increase in page views compared with the\nmicrosite serving that content over the same period last year . In addition,\nthere has been an 11% increase in page visits from the 25–34-year-old age range,\nwhich would indicate an increase in families with younger children – RSPB's key\ntarget demogragraphic.\n\nIn rebuilding their website, RSPB has created an engaging user experience for\ntheir visitors, harnessing personalised content across devices, as well as\nimplementing a streamlined user journey, demonstrating significant business\nresults.\n\n#### Industry\n\nCharity and non-profits\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.rspb.org.uk/",

The decision to adopt Optimizely was driven by the need for a tool capable of accommodating ambitious feature-driven experiments while ensuring a secure and controlled environment.\n- Increased customers adding their received gift card to the Prezzee Wallet from 11% to 50%. Through further optimisations, this has risen to 75% of customers signing up in gift card flow – a significant increase\n- Partnering with The Lumery for onboarding, Prezzee used Optimizely to transform website optimization and feature implementation. Leveraging key features like Visual Editor and Stats Engine, Prezzee achieved a data-driven and agile approach, enhancing user experience and platform performance.\n\n## **Background**\n\nPrezzee is a dynamic and innovative digital gifting platform that has reshaped\nthe way people give and receive gifts in the modern era. Launched in 2014, this\nAustralian-based company has harnessed the power of technology to provide an\nextensive array of digital gift cards from a diverse range of popular brands and\nretailers. Prezzee currently operates in Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom\nand the United States.\n\nPrezzee's user-friendly mobile app and website have redefined the art of gift-\ngiving, offering unparalleled convenience and speed. With a commitment to\nsimplicity and sustainability, Prezzee has become a go-to solution for\nindividuals and businesses seeking a hassle-free and eco-friendly way to share\ntheir sentiments on various occasions. In this digital age, Prezzee's evolution\nhighlights the transformative potential of technology in revolutionizing\ntraditional practices and enhancing the overall gift-giving experience.\n\nPrezzee’s journey with Optimizely’s Web Experimentation platform, supported by\npartner The Lumery, began in April 2022, with implementation occuring in May 2022.**Problem**\n\nPrezzee faced significant challenges before embracing Optimizely for\nexperimentation. As Andrew Harman (Senior Product Manager at Prezzee) explained,\nPrezzee had already initially embarked on the journey of optimizing conversion\nrates in their marketing efforts, focusing on minor enhancements. However, they\nsoon realized that their aspirations extended beyond incremental changes. They\nsought to validate broader and more intricate concepts, test market responses,\nand evaluate customer reactions to feature-rich alterations, transcending simple\nA/B testing of elements like images or headings.\n\nIn addition to their experimentation challenges, Prezzee grappled with\noperational hurdles, particularly in the realm of enabling marketing to complete\nexperiments end to end. The Marketing team lacked the technical support\nessential for safely developing, and launching experiments. Understanding the\npotential disruptions and risks of unguided marketing experimentation, they\nrecognized the imperative of establishing a robust delivery model supported by\ntechnical teams.\n\nUltimately, Prezzee's decision to embrace Optimizely stemmed from their desire\nto tackle complex experimentation challenges head-on. They needed a tool capable\nof accommodating their ambitious feature-driven experiments while concurrently\nestablishing a secure and controlled environment for experimentation company-\nwide. Optimizely emerged as the solution that would help Prezzee overcome these\nobstacles and achieve their broader experimentation objectives.**Benefits &\nSolution**\n\nPrezzee's journey with Optimizely was complemented by their partnership with The\nLumery, who facilitated their onboarding process. They opted for an assisted\nonboarding program as part of their sales experience, with The Lumery overseeing\nthe initiative. The onboarding program primarily revolved around comprehensive\ntraining on the Optimizely system, and a focus on experimentation fundamentals\nand design. Additionally, The Lumery conducted site audits, collaborating\nclosely with Prezzee to develop their experimentation approach and launch their\nfirst experiment. This engagement proved to be a valuable knowledge booster,\nequipping Prezzee with the expertise needed to harness the full potential of\nOptimizely for their experimentation needs.\n\nAfter a smooth onboarding process, the Prezzee team quickly got to work in\nleveraging Optimizely’s experimentation platforms to elevate the digital\nexperience for its customers whilst testing and iterating on new ideas, product\nlaunches and conversion optimisation and strategy.\n\nPrezzee harnessed the power of Optimizely's Web Experimentation platform to\ntransform its approach to website optimization and feature implementation.\nBefore adopting Optimizely, Prezzee faced challenges in assessing the impact of\nchanges made to their platform. They relied on best practices, user feedback,\nand some quantifiable data, but lacked certainty about the outcomes of their\nupdates.\n\nWith Optimizely, they gained the ability to conduct controlled experiments,\ngathering precise data on how each change performed. Notably, Prezzee even\nutilized Optimizely’s platform to hide certain code changes, effectively\ncreating a defacto control group through varying the experience using\nOptimizely. This innovative approach allowed them to validate enhancements and\nadapt quickly based on the results. It also addressed limitations, such as the\nneed to interact with backend systems or access their design system, by enabling\nthem to build features directly into their source code. By leveraging\nOptimizely, Prezzee achieved a data-driven and agile approach to website\noptimization, enhancing their user experience and overall platform performance.\n\nThe organisation now utilises key Web Experimentation features such as the\n**Visual Editor** , and **Stats Engine** , which makes sure that experiments\nreach statistical significance as quickly as possible. Andrew Harman detailed\nthat Prezzee use the Stats Engine as ‘a complete source of truth for experiment\nperformance’, highlighting the trust internal teams have in the data\nOptimizely’s platform",

Andrew Harman detailed\nthat Prezzee use the Stats Engine as ‘a complete source of truth for experiment\nperformance’, highlighting the trust internal teams have in the data\nOptimizely’s platform provides. This complete trust in Optimizely’s platform has\nfacilitated a shift in culture at Prezzee. Now, decisions can be validated by\nclear data that senior leadership can trust and act upon.\n\nExperimentation in general is about gaining insights and validating theories\nwith data, removing gut feel. Optimizely, in particular, offers a unique level\nof customization and control, making it a flexible and feature-rich tool that's\neasy to use\n\nAndrew Harman\n\nSenior Product Manager\n\nFaced with a strategic decision to make gift card recipients mandatory to add\ntheir cards to a digital wallet, Prezzee leveraged Optimizely to conduct a\nseries of experiments to find the best approach.\n\nThey explored different scenarios, including making wallet addition mandatory\nand leaving it optional but with prominent nudges for sign-ups. These\nexperiments encompassed a range of user interface changes, prompts, and\ngamification elements designed to gather insights and user feedback.\n\nRemarkably, the experiment results showed that leaving wallet addition optional\nbut with strong prompts led to nearly as many sign-ups as the mandatory approach\nwhile delivering a superior user experience. By carefully optimizing the user\njourney and finding the right balance between encouraging sign-ups and\nmaintaining user satisfaction, Prezzee achieved impressive results.\n\nThis data-driven approach not only improved sign-up rates but also had a\nprofound impact on executive decision-making within the company. Armed with\nconcrete data and insights, the company chose to retain the optional but highly\nencouraged sign-up approach, avoiding the potential backlash that could have\ncome with a mandatory requirement.\n\nThe business experienced substantial success as a result of this\nexperimentation. Monthly account creations surged, with approximately 100,000 to\n150,000 new members signing up each month—a significant increase.\n\nInitially, the experiment involved triggering an existing sign-up modal using\nOptimizely, and applying minor UI changes to ensure the customer experience was\nconsistent to the context. A customer could close the modal to access their gift\ncard like before without signing in.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nPrezzee's future plans in the realm of experimentation and optimization are\nfocused on scaling their efforts and expanding their reach. As Andrew Harman\nexplained, the business aims to extend the scope of experimentation across more\nteams or \"squads\" within the organization. The goal is to conduct a greater\nnumber of experiments, which will allow them to continuously enhance their user\nexperience and business outcomes.\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation",

    "content": "# Prezzo re-invents their digital engagement\n\n## Something new on the menu\n\nFollowing its offline rebrand, Prezzo turned its attention to their digital\nstrategy. With the competition in the casual dining market becoming more\nsaturated, and new entrants using disruptive technologies to gain traction,\nPrezzo found that they too could differentiate themselves through their digital\nexperience.\n\nThe ambition was to use the digital channel to attract more casual diners, and\nconvert them into loyal customers, putting Prezzo back at the forefront of the\ncasual dining market. Optimizely’s partner Zone was brought in to help Prezzo\nrealise this ambition.\n\n## The Strategy\n\nPrezzo’s digital strategy was clear: they needed a new brand identity to match\ntheir new offline brand. Their website, emails and other digital communications\nneeded to be brought together and optimised for mobile. In addition, they needed\nto better understand their customer’s journey so they could deliver a truly\npersonalized experience. For this they needed to utilise the power of their\ncustomer data and marketing automation.\n\nTo achieve their digital strategy, Prezzo needed a brand new website which\nembraced the new Prezzo visual design and was enriched with features their old\nsite lacked.\n\nThe new features:\n\n- Full content management capabilities\n- Online booking facility\n- Mobile optimised and responsive\n- Single Customer View\n- Integration with marketing automation platform\n- Building a market-leading website was the first part of Prezzo’s digital strategy. They now needed to reengineer the way they interacted with their customer base through digital.\n\nPrezzo really needed to understand their customers through analyzing the data\nthey held on them. This would help them segment their data to understand where\ncustomers were in the journey (new diner, lapsed diner, loyal diner) so they\ncould send tailored email communications and show personalized web content. They\nwould then be able to create the right communications and flows that would help\nthem convert a new or lapsed diner into a loyal diner. And keep their loyal\ncustomers happy.\n\nSo choosing a web content management system and marketing automation platform\nthat integrated with each other (Optimizely CMS and ExactTarget ERCM) was an\nessential consideration for Prezzo’s digital strategy. And to ensure Prezzo’s\nmarketing team were more effective and efficient, it was important that they\ncould create and customise their ERCM email templates in-house, rather than\nrelying on an agency.\n\n## The Build\n\nThe new, fully mobile responsive website was built using Optimizely Content\nCloud with a number of features integrated to enable a seamless diner experience\nfrom research to booking:\n\nTo create a Single Customer View and support Prezzo’s ongoing CRM efforts, Zone\nintegrated Optimizely with Exact Target ECRM\n\nWith the use of mobile on the rise, a seamless location integration is vital to\nuser experience. Optimizely's Find service was utilized to support spontaneous\ndining decisions made on mobile devices.\n\nDriving bookings through social was always a key ambition, so the Twitter API\nwas used to generate social content.\n\nFor the crucial online reservation capabilities, the website was fully\nintegrated with the Bookatable system. It was critical this worked seamlessly\nwith Optimizely Find.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nThough the website was relaunched in the first quarter of 2015, Prezzo saw an\nincrease in the number of voucher codes redeemed, as well as the number of\ntakeaways and gift cards ordered through the website, suggesting we've found the\nright balance of brand and function.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.prezzorestaurants.co.uk/",

Although the\ncompany was pleased with the amount of traffic, it needed to find a better way\nto respond to the browsing behavior of each visitor.\n\n## Emails triggers sent at the right time\n\nTo better monitor and respond to visitor behavior, The White Company turned to\nOptimizely Intelligence Cloud and the capability Email Product Recommendations,\nThe White Company was able to communicate with customers through email at\nexactly the right point. Rather than sending customer emails in batches, they\ncould instead be sent based on visitor behavior and actions tracked in real\ntime.Optimizely Email Product Recommendations includes ten automated behavioral\ntargeting strategies. To determine how much in sales each strategy could bring\nin, The White Company commissioned Optimizely to produce a Customer Value Index.\n\n“The Customer Value Index report was useful because it quantified the results we\ncould expect from implementing each strategy,” says Jo Stone, Retention\nMarketing Manager. “This meant that we could prioritize which one to go for\nfirst and the order in which other ones would be rolled out.”\n\nThe White Company realized that there was a tremendous opportunity to unlock a\nsignificant amount of hidden sales. It decided to start with an abandoned basket\nstrategy, as this represented the greatest return of all the strategies\navailable.\n\n## 16% of email recipients completed the purchase\n\nThe email trigger campaign for abandoned baskets was easy to set up. Once in\nplace, The White Company saw fantastic returns coming through very quickly.\n\nOver a three-month period, 270,000 visitors qualified for inclusion in the\nabandoned basket campaign. Of those visitors, 16% of them clicked through the\nemail and went on to complete their purchase. The White Company, therefore, was\nable to recover a sale that had potentially been lost.\n\n“We were very pleased with how quickly and easily we were able to implement the\nemail triggers,” says Stone. “We saw fantastic returns coming through almost\nimmediately, and we are excited about adopting the other strategies that are now\navailable to us.”\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail",

Learn more now.\n\n## Challenge\n\nOptimizely's marketing organization, not unlike many other marketing teams, was\nfacing operational challenges including siloed teams and channels, a top-down\ndecision-making culture often led by the Highest Paid Person's Opinion (HIPPO),\nand the absence of a common or shared system. Their reliance on a generic\nproject management tool, specifically Asana, highlighted the need for a solution\npurpose-built for marketers.\n\nWhile work could be assigned within Asana, all of the content creation and\nexecution had to happen in external tools. It was commonplace for disparate\nPDFs, spreadsheets and PowerPoints to be flying back and forth via Teams and\nemail, making it difficult to keep track of the latest version of assets. It was\nalso a siloed system that was disconnected from the rest of their Optimizely One\ntools, and therefore, pushed efficiency to the back burner.\n\nOptimizely recognized that these are common challenges for marketing\norganizations, and at the end of 2020, acquired Welcome, an industry-leading\ncontent marketing platform, which served as the catalyst for their complete\nmarketing transformation and has become the connecting thread across Optimizely\nOne.\n\n## Solution\n\nActing as their own best use case, Optimizely's marketing team relies on\nOptimizely One—their shared operating system that enables every part of the\nmarketing lifecycle.\n\nThey have transformed from a request-based organization with little visibility\ninto what's being worked on and what's coming next, to an agile team that’s\nempowered to make decisions by being able to easily view marketing plans and\nstay aligned with clearly-defined marketing priorities.\n\nTheir strategic approach is now built on four guiding pillars: brand, Big Bet,\nintegrated campaigns, and content and activities. This framework ensures that\nevery element of their marketing—from planning, content creation, and delivery\nto personalization and experimentation—is strategically aligned within\nOptimizely One.\n\nThe beauty of Optimizely One is that it makes all of this easy on our marketing\npractitioners, through a single, seamless workflow.\n\nShafqat Islam\n\nCMO, Optimizely\n\n#### Simplified Collaboration with a Platform Purpose-Built for Marketers\n\nBeginning with the foundational aspects of the marketing lifecycle: work intake,\nplanning, content creation, and asset storage, Content Marketing Platform (CMP)\nhas revolutionized Optimizely’s marketing team's efficiency and output.\n\nProviding a comprehensive view into upcoming activities through various calendar\ndisplays, the platform provides maximum visibility for everyone on the marketing\nteam (and beyond).

Shared campaign workspaces consolidate all elements\nassociated with a campaign, from briefs and activities to analytics and related\ncontent, streamlining collaboration and eliminating the need for disparate tools\nand scattered assets.\n\nWith Tasks, content creation has become a seamless process, centralizing content\nbriefs and asset creation within a structured workflow. This unified approach\nensures that every team member remains synchronized throughout the content\ndevelopment process.\n\n“We now have a standardized process for how we create campaigns and the tasks\nthat ladder up to them,” said Michiel Dorjee, Optimizely’s director of digital\nexperience. “With Asana, our marketing strategy was request-based—someone would\nfill out a form with a specific ask, and then we’d go off and execute in silos.\nWith CMP, we can actually collaborate on a piece of content (that ladders up to\nan integrated campaign, which ladders up to a 'Big Bet') by bringing people into\nTasks.”\n\nThey also bolster their ideation and content creation efforts with embedded AI\nfunctionality, including text and image generation and chatGPT, which enables\nthem to improve both content quality and velocity.\n\nThe finalized assets find their place in Library, CMP’s native, digital asset\nmanagement tool. Rich with AI features like AI-tagging of uploaded assets and\nautomated rendition generation with smart cropping, asset management is no\nlonger a manual, time-consuming operation. This not only has simplified their\nprocesses around asset management, but also has empowered their marketing team\nto effortlessly access and use the latest, brand-approved content without\nnavigating through multiple platforms (or asking, \"Is this the most up-to-date\nversion?\").\n\nThe total marketing transformation led by the migration from Asana to Content\nMarketing Platform has had a material impact on Optimizely’s marketing team\nefficiency, enabling them to run 200+ campaigns spanning four “Big Bets” and six\nintegrated campaigns, while spending 31% less budget than the previous year.\n\nBecause we've streamlined our processes and are able to see what everyone is\nworking on, we can find areas for collaboration sooner. This has helped us to\nreduce duplicated efforts and work smarter, not harder.\n\nJulia Maguire\n\nDigital Marketing Director, Optimizely\n\n#### Flexible Content Delivery, Honed with a Personalized Touch\n\nOnce campaigns and content are planned and created, they have to be delivered to\ntheir final destination(s). This process has been made simple for Optimizely’s\nmarketing organization with the CMS12+CMP Publishing Integration that connects\nthe two platforms, allowing marketers to plan, create, and collaborate and push\nto the CMS without ever having to leave CMP. This also means that\ntechnical/digital marketers are no longer the blocker for getting content on the\nsite. This has immensely impacted Optimizely’s marketing team’s efficiency when\ndelivering content.\n\nWhile CMS12, the latest version of Optimizely’s trusted Platform as a Service\n(PaaS) CMS, continues to be the backbone of Optimizely.com, the marketing team\nrecently encountered a unique use case that demanded a fresh perspective – the\nlaunch of their Brand Portal. Facing the challenge of enhancing user experience\nand adopting a more contemporary design, they sought a solution that was both\nmodern and user-friendly. In response, they leveraged the versatility of SaaS\nCore, the newest (SaaS) version of Optimizely CMS.\n\nThis strategic move allowed them to decouple the front-end, providing a modular\nand flexible framework to meet the demands of their evolving requirements. The\nimplementation of SaaS Core enabled them to ensure simplicity, without\ncompromising flexibility. This decoupled structure not only aligns with more\nmodern development practices, but also has empowered their team to adapt swiftly\nto changing needs.\n\nAgility is key for us. We need to be able to have the flexibility that allows\nour team to make quick adjustments without compromising the quality of the\ndigital experience. Introducing SaaS Core has allowed us to do that.\n\nShafqat Islam\n\nCMO, Optimizely\n\nOnce content is live on a webpage, Optimizely’s digital team relies on Content\nRecommendations and Optimizely Data Platform (ODP) to deliver a tailored (and\noptimal) customer experience. The former allows for easy-to-manage content\npersonalization, using natural language processing to gather topics visitors are\ninterested in and serve them applicable recommendations for content. The latter\nleverages data from their CRM, which enables them to build custom audiences in\nODP for a more intricate approach to personalization (for example, industry,\nengagement, and lead scoring).\n\nWhile these tools, in conjunction with the strategies Optimizely’s marketing\nteam has built around them, have proven exceptional ROI—a noteworthy 50%\nreduction in cost per MQL—they continue to experiment with different methods and\nvariations for maximum impact.\n\n**Which brings us to...**\n\n#### Experimentation and Analysis Equals Continuous Improvement\n\nExperimentation is in Optimizely’s blood, but there’s always room for\nimprovement. With their marketing transformation came a “Big Bet” specific to\nexperimentation, underscoring its importance in the marketing lifecycle:\n“Establish a Culture of Experimentation.”\n\nWhile being a more experimental marketing team hinges on changing the mindset of\nmarketers, it helps to have a platform that empowers team members to get\ninvolved. To do this, Optimizely’s marketing team leverages Experimentation\nCollaboration in conjunction with Feature and Web Experimentation to enable\ntheir marketing team to submit ideas for experiments, build hypotheses,\ncollaborate on assets, execute through structured workflows, track experiments\nand record learnings.\n\nWith Optimizely One’s suite of experimentation tools, Optimizely is able to run\n50+ concurrent tests or at",

    "content": "# Cogent Solutions and Supplies doubles sales\n\nCogent Solutions and Supplies delivers the whole package—ecommerce that empowers\ncustomers and sales reps.\n\n## Creating jobs and building stronger communities through trust, honesty and\n\nintegrity\n\nIn 1988, Phil Ferris dreamed up a mission: employ as many people as possible.\nPhil wanted to create jobs so people could support their families and build\nstronger communities. Phil’s desire to create opportunities for others led him\nto found Cogent Solutions & Supplies, a California-based distributor of\npackaging, logistics and warehouse solutions and automation equipment.\n\nTrust, honesty and integrity were important values to Phil. They remain\nengrained in Cogent’s culture to this day. These values have made Cogent the\npackaging partner that delivers more clarity, more guidance and more expertise\nfor the agriculture, food processing, grocery, healthcare, hospitality, retail,\nmanufacturing and distribution industries.\n\nCogent has earned the most trusted reputation in the industry by providing\nunmatched services and focusing on the success of their employees, customers and\nsuppliers.\n\nAt Cogent, complacency is never an option. Cogent leaders are constantly looking\ntoward the future and thinking about how they can continue to honor Phil’s\nlegacy. To build a stronger future and respond to evolving customer\nexpectations, Cogent voyaged into eCommerce.\n\n## Making customers’ jobs easier\n\nCogent first played their hand at eCommerce with an on-prem solution that was\nlinked to their ERP. The solution was a dated storefront that did not provide\nthe experiences customers were looking for. Cogent wanted to make it as easy and\nefficient as possible for customers to place orders online.\n\nThe company knew they had to get eCommerce right the second time around. So they\npulled in various people to form an eCommerce selection committee that included\nthe purchasing, leadership, product management, marketing and eCommerce teams.\nThe team defined their eCommerce requirements as:\n\n- Integration into the Infor A+ ERP\n- Real-time pricing and inventory\n- Customization for specific accounts\n- Product customization\n- List functionality\n- Ability to easily repeat orders\n- Vendor Managed Inventory\n- Mobile App\n- User-friendly\n\nOptimizely B2B Commerce met all the requirements.\n\nWe were looking for three primary things when we were on the hunt for the right\neCommerce platform. This platform provides ease of use, deep integration with\nour ERP and the ability to provide a custom experience.\n\nWendy Cypert\n\nGeneral Manager and eCommerce Director, Cogent Solutions & Supplies\n\n## Leveraging the B2B functionality within Optimizely B2B Commerce\n\nCogent leverages the “List Management” functionality within Optimizely B2B\nCommerce to offer a catered experience to their customers. Many of their\ncustomers have repeat orders. They order the same set of products most of the\ntime. They don’t want to go hunt around every time they need to make an order.\nLeveraging lists, customers are able to easily go in to Optimizely B2B Commerce,\nplace their order and get on with their day.\n\nA few months after launching Optimizely B2B Commerce, Cogent also launched the\nOptimizely B2B Commerce Mobile App.\n\nWith the mobile app, Cogent’s salespeople are able to help customers manage\ntheir inventory. The team can go online and see the information they need\nanytime. The Optimizely B2B Commerce Mobile App allows salespeople to easily\nhelp manage inventory behind a desk or in the field. With Optimizely B2B\nCommerce, salespeople can go in and impersonate any customer accounts without\nhaving to go into the ERP to find information. Salespeople now enjoy 24/7 access\nto the product catalog whenever they need it.\n\n## Cogent’s new world with Optimizely B2B Commerce\n\nToday, customers can go online and self-serve through the website and the mobile\napp. They can easily look up invoices online, check order status and more. For\nCogent, investing in eCommerce was always about making customers’ lives easier,\nfirst and foremost. But other areas of the business have seen the benefits of\neCommerce as well.\n\nIn an industry where products can quickly become commoditized, Cogent has to\nfind ways to add value to their customers. They can’t just sell boxes or paper\ntowels and be done with it – they wouldn’t survive if that was their go-to-\nmarket-strategy. The new eCommerce experience enables Cogent to add more value\nand build deeper relationships. Now that they are spending less time on tedious\ntasks like checking order status or invoices, the sales team is able to be more\nconsultative in the sales process.\n\nCogent has also increased share of wallet with existing customers. Through\ncontent strategy, segmenting, promotions and personalization, Cogent is seeing\nincreased average order sizes on eCommerce orders.\n\nSince implementing Optimizely B2B Commerce in July 2018, online sales have more\nthan doubled. Prior to that, Cogent was seeing about 6% of sales online. Today,\nthey see nearly 20% of sales online.\n\nAs Cogent looks to the future, they are focused on propelling growth forward.\nCogent is working hand-in-hand with Optimizely to improve the website and\ncontinue offering customers and sales reps better experiences.

Optimizely’s CMS offered the scalability, flexibility, and\nuser-friendly interface required to manage Goodwood's vast content and high\ntraffic volumes, enabling a seamless and engaging digital experience.\n\nThe initial move to Optimizely CMS in 2016 marked a significant improvement, but\nthe sprawling nature of the website still posed challenges. Upgrading to CMS 12\nprovided Goodwood with the tools needed to streamline their content management\nprocesses and improve overall site performance.\n\n**Why CMS 12?** Goodwood’s transition to Optimizely’s CMS 12, the fastest\nversion to date, was driven by the need for improved performance and\nscalability. CMS 12 offers enhanced user experience and access to new\nfunctionalities, essential for Goodwood’s ambitious digital goals. The decision\nto upgrade was a strategic move to leverage the latest advancements in CMS\ntechnology and provide a superior digital experience for their visitors.\n\nCMS 12 improves website performance and reduces load times, crucial for events\nlike the Festival of Speed. Its scalability ensures stability during peak\ntraffic, while new features simplify site management, enhancing the user\nexperience for both administrators and visitors.**Goodwood’s comprehensive\nwebsite redesign** The redesign of Goodwood's website was a comprehensive effort\nto create a modern digital experience that encapsulates the essence of\nGoodwood's premium brand.",

Its scalability ensures stability during peak\ntraffic, while new features simplify site management, enhancing the user\nexperience for both administrators and visitors.**Goodwood’s comprehensive\nwebsite redesign** The redesign of Goodwood's website was a comprehensive effort\nto create a modern digital experience that encapsulates the essence of\nGoodwood's premium brand. The new website features a clean, sleek design with a\nheavy emphasis on high-quality video content, offering an immersive experience\nthat reflects the prestige and elegance of Goodwood.\n\nBrand identity is paramount to Goodwood, and our website must do our brand\njustice. Moving components from Storybook design to the Optimizely CMS\nefficiently and accurately is a crucial way of achieving this. Optimizely is a\ngreat platform for a design-centric business.\n\nSimon Gardiner\n\nHead of Digital Product, Goodwood\n\n**Design and\\*\\***Development Process\\*\\* The redesign process was meticulous and\ninvolved extensive collaboration among Goodwood’s digital team and their trusted\npartner, dotcraft. The process included several key stages:\n\n1. Interactive whiteboarding sessions using Fig Jam allowed stakeholders to contribute their objectives, competitor analysis, and key performance indicators (KPIs). This collaborative approach ensured that the new website met the diverse needs of Goodwood’s different business units, from motorsport events to hospitality services.\n2. All designs were created in Figma, providing a detailed visual representation of the new website. The team utilized Figma’s interactive capabilities to gather feedback and make iterative improvements. This stage was crucial for ensuring the website's design aligned with Goodwood's brand values and visual identity.\n3. Transitioning from Figma to Storybook, the development team built and tested the components before integrating them into Optimizely CMS 12. This method ensured that the final product was both visually appealing and functionally robust. The team focused on creating reusable components to streamline development and ensure consistency across the site.\n4. Migrating content from the old CMS to the new platform was a significant task. The team developed a strategy to ensure a smooth transition, including cleaning up outdated content and optimizing new content for performance and SEO.\n\n## **Enhanced Content Process and Use Cases**\n\nGoodwood's upgrade to CMS 12 and the comprehensive website redesign have\nsignificantly enhanced Goodwood’s digital presence. Advanced features like\nVisitor Groups and the Visual Editor have empowered Goodwood to deliver a\ndynamic, personalized, and visually captivating experience for their audience.\nThe new website not only reflects the luxury and premium nature of the Goodwood\nbrand but also provides an efficient and engaging user experience.\n\nStorytelling is key for us, and structured data significantly enhances it. We've\ncreated brand snippets—little bits of trivia tagged and built as blocks—so\nvisitors see different facts each time they visit a page. This approach keeps\nthe site fresh and engaging. Additionally, incorporating crisp, clean movements\nand ensuring fast load times are crucial for maintaining the luxury feel of our\nsite. Optimizely's DXP and Azure stack's high performance ensure everything runs\nsmoothly.\n\nSimon Gardiner\n\nHead of Digital Product\n\nBy leveraging Optimizely's Visitor Groups, Goodwood can tailor content\ndynamically based on user behaviour and characteristics. This allows them to\ndefine segments such as first-time visitors, returning members, or users engaged\nin specific content categories, ensuring that each visitor receives the most\nrelevant information. This segmentation enhances engagement by showing content\nthat aligns with the visitor’s interests and past interactions, providing\nflexibility and control to quickly adapt to changing user behaviours and\npreferences.The Visual Editor in Optimizely's CMS has been instrumental in\nGoodwood's ability to create and preview content seamlessly. Key benefits\ninclude real-time previews that allow quick switches to visual preview mode to\nsee how content blocks stack up, ensuring that the layout and design are\nvisually appealing and functional across devices. Mobile optimization features\nenable easy checks on how content renders on different devices, ensuring a\nconsistent and high-quality user experience on mobile platforms.Efficient\nediting and instant publishing allow for quick iterations and immediate updates,\ncrucial during events or promotional periods. Additionally, the ability to\nvisualize how different visitor groups will see the content makes it easier to\nensure that personalization strategies are effectively implemented.\n\nThe benefit of the Visual Editor is key. It allows us to quickly switch into\nvisual preview mode to see how blocks work together, view the mobile rendering,\nand check how different visitor groups see content. This capability is\ninvaluable and can be done within a few clicks, providing a practical view of\ndynamic changes that Storybook alone can't offer.\n\nSimon Gardiner\n\nHead of Digital Product\n\nGoodwood’s focus on storytelling is significantly enhanced by the CMS’s ability\nto manage structured data. This capability allows them to utilize dynamic,\ninterchangeable content blocks, such as trivia facts and quotes, that keep the\nsite feeling fresh and engaging for repeat visitors. Tagging and associating\ncontent with relevant metadata ensures that the most appropriate and interesting\nsnippets are displayed, enriching the visitor's experience with every visit.\n\nUser management within Optimizely’s CMS allows Goodwood to control who can edit,\npublish, and change content, providing a structured workflow that is essential\nfor maintaining the integrity of their site. This capability is particularly\nuseful during high-pressure periods, such as when new events go on sale, as it\nfacilitates the preparation, review, and approval of multiple updates\nsimultaneously.Security is another critical aspect where Optimizely excels,\nallowing Goodwood to focus on their core mission without undue concern.

Established in 1993, the company has grown to\nbecome one of the leading providers of car insurance, home insurance, and\nvarious other financial products. With a customer-centric approach and a\ncommitment to transparency, Admiral has garnered a reputation for offering\ncompetitive rates and embracing technological advancements to enhance its\nservices.\n\nAdmiral’s Optimisation Management team, led by Ben Williams and David Dewey\n(both Optimisation Managers), look after the conversion rate optimisation (CRO)\nof the entire end-to-end customer lifecycle journey. Ben Williams’ team focus on\nmanaging experiments related to household, motor, travel, MultiCover and\nMultiCar offerings primarily on the website's quote engine. Dewey focuses on\nmaintaining customer engagement and retention within “Admiral 2.0”. His role\ninvolves preventing customer attrition by optimising experiences in ‘My\nAccount’, the quote engine, and landing pages to encourage user retention and\navoid unnecessary calls to the call centre.\n\nThe team serve a plethora of internal stakeholders, including the marketing,\naffiliate marketing, product, Pay-Per-Click (PPC), value optimisation and\ncustomer relationship management teams respectively.\n\nAdmiral’s journey began with Optimizely in February 2021.\n\n## Problem\n\nBen Williams, shared that, after using A/B testing tool Oracle Maxymiser for\nseven years previously, there was a desire to search the market for a potential\nnew and improved experimentation platform. He detailed that Admiral embarked on\na thorough evaluation of web experimentation platforms in 2019, The evaluation\nprocess was initially delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a team merger to\nunify Williams’ and Dewey’s previously separate teams.\n\nAdmiral initiated a tender process, with several experimentation platform\nvendors under consideration. During the evaluation, Optimizely stood out for\nseveral reasons. Optimizely’s response during the Request for Proposal (RFP)\nstage demonstrated a commitment that resonated with Admiral. The proof of\nconcept (POC) further solidified their confidence, with a clean and user-\nfriendly platform.\n\nAdditionally, Both the optimisation team and leadership at Admiral recognized\nOptimizely as the superior choice, citing its proactive engagement, user-\nfriendly platform, and overall better service.\n\nTherefore, Optimizely’s full experimentation suite, containing both Web\nExperimentation and Feature Experimentation products was selected by Admiral to\nsupport the insurance giant on its A/B testing and optimisation endeavours.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdmiral’s Optimisation Managers received hands-on training, onboarding and\nguidance from the Optimizely team. Ben Williams shared that Admiral were\ndelighted with the training they received, explaining that Optimizely “took us\nby the hand, providing extensive training sessions with various friendly and\nhelpful experts… everyone was super friendly, and this really helped the process\nseem enjoyable rather than just another boring onboarding process.”\n\nSince we onboarded Optimizely the efficiency of the team has definitely\nincreased. We have a lot of processes in place now and we collaborate with\nOptimizely’s Rapid Experimentation team a lot to help improve these processes so\nwe can get tests out the door quicker. We noticed value straight away with\nOptimizely, mainly from being able to use the tool instantly and launching tests\nwithin the first month on onboarding. Velocity increased straight away meaning\nmore winning tests and greater ROI.\n\nBen Williams\n\nOptimisation Manager\n\nAfter onboarding, Admiral and quickly got to work in leveraging Optimizely’s\nexperimentation platforms to elevate the digital experience for its subscribers\nwhilst testing and iterating on new ideas, product launches and conversion\noptimisation and strategy.\n\nWhilst Admiral are no newcomers to the discipline of web experimentation and A/B\nTesting, the organisation’s renewed and targeted focus on conversion rate\noptimisation, supported by Optimizely’s platform and Rapid Experimentation team,\nhas paid dividends.\n\nAdmiral utilises key Web Experimentation features such as the **Visual Editor**\n, which allows users to easily make visual and text changes to webpages and\n**Stats Engine** , which makes sure that experiments reach statistical\nsignificance as quickly as possible. Admiral also gain value from Optimizely’s\n**Stats Accelerator** , which allows its users’ experiments to reach statistical\nsignificance up to 300% faster on experiments with many variations (at least\nthree), utilising dynamic updates and weighting to the tests in order to reduce\ntime to finding the best significant variation.\n\nBen Williams noted that “as an optimisation team, we believe the results and\ntrust them”, highlighting the full confidence the team have in the statistical\nvalidity of Optimizely’s experimentation platform.\n\nThe velocity of experiments has dramatically increased throughout the\norganisation.

Williams also shared that “we have certainly\nreduced the time it takes to launch a test as you can tell from the velocity. We\nuse the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) visual editor tool a lot more\nwith Optimizely which cuts down developer and design time.”\n\nThe experiments ran by Admiral’s optimisation teams are heavily supported by\nOptimizely’s **Rapid Experimentation (Rapid X)** team. Admiral employ a\nsystematic internal process for running experiments. Stakeholder briefs or\ninternally generated ideas are discussed during weekly meetings with Rapid X\nteam members, where test concepts are discussed and refined. Subsequently, these\nideas enter project management for sizing up and development, involving\ncollaboration with multiple design teams.\n\nWith a structured approach, the process leaves much of the implementation in the\nhands of the Rapid X team, leaning on their expertise to manage the large parts\nof the testing process, from sizing up projects, collaborating with design\nteams, to development and QA. The trust Admiral places in the Optimizely team,\noften regarding Rapid X team members as one of their own, is a testament to the\nstrong relationship that has been forged. This trust in the Rapid\nExperimentation team has resulted in a smooth and successful testing process.\n\n## Integrations\n\nOptimizely’s **Web Experimentation** platform integrates seamlessly with\nAdmiral’s internal applications and software such as Contentsquare and Get\nFeedback.\n\nContentsquare's analytics platform, tracking billions of digital interactions,\nprovides invaluable insights into customer behaviour, empowering Admiral's teams\nto make data-driven decisions for improving customer experiences, growing\nrevenue, and fostering innovation. The bi-directional integration combines\nContentsquare's unique customer behaviour insights with Optimizely's progressive\ndelivery and experimentation capabilities, enabling Admiral to innovate\nconfidently and derive maximum value from customer experience initiatives.\n\nAdditionally, the integration with Get Feedback, a survey tool, allows Admiral\nto capture customer sentiments during key touchpoints in the quote engine\njourney. Admiral prioritizes the regular use of Contentsquare for post-QA\nanalysis, ensuring variations align with expectations and proactively addressing\nany issues to uphold a seamless customer experience. This integration strategy\nshowcases Admiral's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies for\noptimal digital optimisation and customer-centric strategies.\n\n## Use Case 1 – MultiCar Conversion Variance Testing\n\nIn an innovative experiment, the Admiral Optimisation Team undertook a\ncomprehensive MultiCar insurance proposition to enhance the online conversion\nprocess for customers interested in bundling multiple vehicles or combining car\nand home insurance policies. Through three meticulous iterations and extensive\nworkshops, the team refined the user experience, addressing challenges in\nconveying the benefits of policy bundling on a single screen.\n\nFour variations were tested originally. After the initial phase, where variants\nwere reduced to V1 and V2, a crucial observation led to a modification in the\ncall-to-action (CTA) from green buttons to a more compelling \"Get Your Discount\"\nmessage. Despite a notable drop in CTA clicks compared to the control, the\noverall conversion rates for both multi and single car insurance increased in\nthe variants.\n\nNotably, the final iteration chosen, labelled V2, also featured a dedicated FAQ\nsection. The V2 iteration proved to be the most successful, . The experiment\nalso extended to MultiCover scenarios, such as adding home insurance to an\nexisting car insurance plan, resulting in a similar financial gain.\n\nThe process involved multiple months of testing, emphasising a patient and\nthorough approach, including design workshops and iterations, showcasing the\nAdmiral’s commitment to improving its digital offering and reducing customer\ndecision fatigue.\n\n### Control version\n\n### V2 Variation (final version selected)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdmiral is gearing up for a transformative 12-18 months, with a key focus on\nenhancing personalisation capabilities. The insurance giant, having adopted a\nnew internal structure known as ‘Scaled Agile’, look to focus on greater\nalignment with the broader organisational goals. This shift ensures that\noptimisation efforts are not isolated but are integral to the company's overall\nobjectives.\n\nOptimisation Manager, David Dewey, highlights the evolving mindset within the\norganization, as executives having gained a solid year of experience, leading to\nincreased confidence in building tests and generating a robust backlog of ideas.\n\nWith Optimizely’s experimentation platform, support from the Rapid\nExperimentation team and the Contentsquare integration providing valuable\ninsights, Admiral aims to leverage its newfound alignment and knowledge to\nimplement an extensive series of tests, thereby staying at the forefront of\nindustry trends and customer-centric strategies.\n\nThe emphasis on testing, personalisation and collaborative optimisation reflects\nAdmiral's commitment to evolving with the dynamic landscape of the insurance\nindustry for years to come.\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n- Feature Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://admiral.com/",

Losberger De Boer's event solutions are present\nat the biggest sporting, political and cultural events.Their commercial\nsolutions are built to be scalable and relocatable, providing flexibility for\nmultiple purposes, including warehousing and storage. Losberger De Boer’s\nrapidly deployed products for emergency response and defense uses are trusted by\nmilitary and humanitarian organizations in emergencies across the world.\n\nWhile Losberger De Boer’s products are of exceptional quality and variety, their\nstrength is understanding their customers' needs. They emphasize helping\ncustomers achieve desired goals by matching customers to their offerings.\n\nAlthough Losberger De Boer strives to be a one-stop solutions provider to\ncustomers, their fractured digital architecture affected their online presence.\nTheir digital architecture included multiple websites, online marketing assets,\ntools, activities and collaboration with global marketing agencies. Thus began\nLosberger De Boer’s ambitious digital transformation to merge all company sites\ninto a global digital platform with 'One brand, one platform, one-on-one\nexperience' forming the foundation of their digital revamp.\n\n# **Fractured digital architecture with archaic sites and systems**\n\nWith nearly 10 different websites that run on different servers and other online\nassets including 50 social accounts, several Google Ads (and Bing) accounts,\nGoogle Analytics, Tag Manager and Search Console accounts, Losberger De Boer\nonline landscape was scattered and existed in silos. Multiple assets meant\nmultiple stakeholders and data silo’s to get on the same page as well. Or having\na structural Webdata Reporting and Monitoring base for performance marketing.\n\nIn addition, their CMS, CRM and databases were not well-integrated, they lacked\nefficient reporting and content management tools, and content was not always\ntailored to customers.\n\nThe fractured architecture led to outdated websites, unstructured lead\ngeneration tracking and failure to capture valuable website data. There were\nplenty of missed opportunities for interaction and lead nurturing with\nstakeholders as well as not maximizing the potential of Losberger De Boer’s data\nand digital assets. Losberger De Boer understood that their digital\ntransformation not only had to address and rectify these issues, but it also had\nto have the ability to grow and expand along with the company.\n\n# **Losberger De Boer’s world-class digital transformation**\n\nEmbarking on this journey was an important next step for Losberger De Boer, but\nthey knew selecting the right solution and implementation partner was integral\nto the success of their digital vision of 'One brand, one platform, one-on-one\nexperience'.\n\nOnce Losberger De Boer and iO were connected, iO wasted no time in laying out\nthe starting blocks for Losberger De Boer’s new digital solution. iO’s response\nto Losberger De Boer’s RFP detailed their desire to support Losberger De Boer’s\nmission and vision for the newly merged company through a deep understanding of\nLosberger De Boer. An experienced Optimizely partner, iO also highlighted the\nimportance of engaging all stakeholders in Losberger De Boer’s digital\ntransformation in executing a compelling solution that will reinforce Losberger\nDe Boer’s best-in-class offerings to customers and talents. As digital solutions\ncan evolve with a company, iO understood that Losberger De Boer’s digital\ntransformation will not be a one-off project, rather it will be a long-term\ncollaborative partnership. A new international platform was the starting point\nof digital transition and further online marketing growth.\n\niO proposed to Losberger De Boer a few platforms that may suit Losberger De\nBoer’s needs and, Optimizely was chosen based on multiple factors including\nscalability, future growth and iO’s advice.\n\nTo reflect their global presence, Losberger De Boer’s new website had to be\nmultilingual and multimarket while maintaining a unified appearance in-line with\ntheir brand image. It also had to be flexible in integrating with multiple\nonline marketing technology software and potential future tool additions to keep\ntheir digital solution ahead of competitors. Content also had to be relevant to\ntheir customers to ensure that their website meets users' expectations, but also\ncontributes to a higher customer experience.\n\nAs part of the foundation of Losberger De Boer’s digital solution, iO\nimplemented Optimizely’s CMS that has real-time and multi-site statistics on a\nlive dashboard and provides an abundance of possibilities for developers to\ntackle problems in creative ways. Equipped with their knowledge of Optimizely,\nthis allowed iO to swiftly respond to Losberger De Boer’s requests with several\noptions in reaching their objectives.\n\nLosberger De Boer’s website leveraged Optimizely Forms to create web forms for\ncontact forms to the different international Sales teams.

Over time, the products and services\nexpanded, ownership changed, and the company even rebranded, but the customer-\nfirst philosophy has always held true. When customers come to Source Atlantic\nwith challenges, the Source Atlantic team works with them to find a creative\nsolution, no matter what.\n\nToday, Source Atlantic offers plumbing and heating, electrical and industrial\nproducts and employs more than 500 people, with 24 branches across Canada.\nSource Atlantic partners with hundreds of world-class suppliers, offers a\nmultitude of specialized and technical services and has many value-added\nbusiness solutions designed to improve customers’ efficiency and productivity.\n\nSource Atlantic is willing to go where no distribution company has gone before.\nThey’ve built motors that extend up to 30,000 horsepower. They’ve created the\nmost advanced corrosion coating available in the market today. They were even\nnamed one of Canada’s Best Managed Companies.\n\nAs time has passed, the market has evolved and customers’ expectations and needs\nhave changed. But Source Atlantic has been right there with them identifying\ntheir needs and developing new solutions to help answer the problems that\nthey’re having.\n\nThere are some B2B features that are standard in any eCommerce platform. But\nEpiserver InsiteCommerce [now Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud], has advanced\nfeature sets that allow us to develop a B2B solution that works perfectly\n\nMatt Hanlon\n\nApplied Innovation & Technology Manager, Source Atlantic\n\n## A focus on digital transformation\n\nSource Atlantic knew that focusing on providing better digital experiences for\ntheir customers and their sales team was the only way to bring their business\ninto the future. In 2011, the company began focusing on data and business\nintelligence. Transformation launched with an ERP upgrade and a Learning\nManagement System implementation. The company is constantly monitoring data\nabout inventory forecasting, sales history, usage data and more.\n\nDigital transformation did not end with an ERP upgrade or an LMS deployment.\nERPs are powerful but they are not built to power eCommerce experiences. ERPs\nhave limitations in terms of finding items or using keywords.\n\nIn order to build a customer facing experience, Source Atlantic began their\nsearch for an eCommerce platform. The platform would enable the team to add\nproducts, bring in more enriched content and give customers the ability to\nsearch the catalog and find what they were looking for more efficiently.\n\nIn addition, account managers needed access to a portal that enabled them to\nshare information about Source Atlantic products. Launching eCommerce was all\nabout enabling the Source Atlantic team and their customers to do their jobs\nmore efficiently.\n\nPrior to investing in a more sophisticated eCommerce solution, Source Atlantic\nhad a simplistic site designed for use by a few contract customers. The site had\nvery few items and searchability was limited.\n\nSource Atlantic knew that if they were going to do eCommerce right, they needed\nto gain control of their product catalog. As a member of AD (Affiliated\nDistributors), Source Atlantic had access to AD’s data feed and made content a\ncore cornerstone of their eCommerce implementation. The bulk of Source\nAtlantic’s data comes into Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud through the AD content\nfeed.\n\n## Selecting Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud\n\nSource Atlantic conducted rigorous research when seeking an eCommerce platform.\nThey sent an RFQ, scheduled demos, talked with customers, consulted external\ncompanies, compared feature sets and more. Ultimately they chose Optimizely B2B\nCommerce Cloud because of the platform’s focus on B2B and business user\naccessibility.\n\n## Growing share of wallet and driving engagement\n\nIn distribution, the majority of business typically comes from less than 20% of\ndistributors’ customer base. Therefore, it is important to ensure repeat\ncustomers stay happy. In distribution, one benefit of eCommerce is often about\ngrowing and increasing share of wallet with larger, repeat customers.\n\nThrough training of salespeople, creation of portals and microsites, use of\npromotions and other eCommerce functionality, Source Atlantic has been laser-\nfocused on growing their share of wallet.\n\nBuilt-in SEO functionality is enabling customers to find more products.\nCustomers are self-serving and account managers are now able to offer more\nconsultative services because they aren’t spending time taking orders or\nchecking statuses.\n\nSource Atlantic is enabling their customers to do business with them however\nthey choose. They aren’t forcing them to go online or go into the branch.\nInstead, Source Atlantic is creating channels that allow customers to do\nbusiness more efficiently and however they choose. They are using a hybrid,\nmultichannel approach.\n\nSince launching the platform, Source Atlantic’s monthly web visitors have more\nthan doubled. They are leveraging core B2B functionality in the platform like\nbudget management tools, custom fields, requisition rules, complex pricing and\nmore. They are working toward a greater share of wallet and are giving their\ncustomers better access to their catalog.\n\nOver the next few years, Source Atlantic aims to manage customer assets,\nequipment and inventory. The goal is to build out a centralized digital\ndashboard or portal so customers can conduct business in one area.\n\nSource Atlantic is a historic distributor. They have seen success by building a\nteam made up of talented and passionate who are thinking about how they can help\nthe company thrive in the future.

Previously, TestEquity was seeing roughly 15 RFQs\nper day, which increased to 27-30 per day after launch. TestEquity’s RFQs are\ntypically valued at around $8,000.

SRAM designs and manufactures high-end bicycle\ncomponents, including shifters, derailleurs, brakes, chains, suspension, power\nmeters, and other cycling parts.\n\nWhile SRAM had the ability to digitally enable their robust network of bike\nmanufacturers, distributors, and retail partners through an Optimizely-based B2B\ndigital commerce site, they knew they had an opportunity with their B2C site to\nexpand their market reach, own their brand experience from start to finish, and\nbetter understand their customers’ buying patterns and needs.\n\nLooking for a partner with deep technical expertise, SRAM chose to work with\nBlueBolt on their B2C project. BlueBolt developed the solution on the Optimizely\nCommerce platform, leveraging the brand’s previously implemented B2B site and\ninfrastructure to create an experience that demonstrates the excellence of the\nSRAM brand, while providing not only a way for customers to purchase, but also\nto learn more about SRAM products through rich content.\n\n## Project objectives\n\n- A redesigned site experience on desktop and mobile to enable a frictionless research and buying journey across the site, including a shared shopping cart across brands.\n- Implement a custom configurator specific to the Quarq product site, which enables a user to build their chosen product directly on the product detail page. This is a unique customization within Optimizely that takes any number of SKU’s and drills down options based on the buyer’s selections, to deliver one final finished product and price.\n- Provide refreshed brand experiences for Quarq and Zipp, with the addition of the “My Account” section that enables users to store their information, access order history, and create wish lists, resulting in more meaningful customer touchpoints and encouraging brand loyalty across all of SRAM’s brands.\n- Provide a way for their loyal fanbase to further immerse themselves in the SRAM lifestyle and connect with the brands directly.\n\nQuote Block (New): Quote\n\n## Blueprinting the B2B approach for B2C operations\n\nSRAM wanted to leverage the “piping” already in place for their B2B portal on\nOptimizely, which enables their thousands of OEM’s, distributors, and retailers\nworldwide, to spin up a channel to reach their B2C customers. Optimizely was a\nrobust and flexible option to fill both their B2B and B2C needs with one\nplatform, and provide the rich content tools to bring the SRAM lifestyle to life\nonsite.\n\nHaving already implemented a rich B2B portal for their global network of OEM’s,\nDistributors, and Retailers, SRAM now sought to connect deeper with end-users of\ntheir products and own the brand experience throughout. BlueBolt worked with\nSRAM to come up with the right mix of Content and Commerce to enable this B2C\njourney on the site, while also providing the facilities to locate local\ndistributors and retailers through their global dealer locator onsite. Through\nthese efforts their customers have the opportunity to purchase through their\nchannel partners or directly from SRAM. SRAM also now has the ability to own the\nbrand experience from the point of entry on the site to the post-purchase\ncustomer service and follow-up experience.\n\nOptimizely Commerce Cloud offers SRAM the ability to scale as their business\ngrows. Hosted on the Microsoft Azure Cloud, the website is sheltered from\ndowntime that may result in problematic customer experiences. This serverless\nenvironment mean the SRAM team can focus on a truly customer-centric experience.\n\nAs part of this implementation, SRAM integrated to their PIM for product data,\nalong with their global SAP ERP system for inventory and order management.\n\n## Planning for the long-run\n\nSRAM has been working with Optimizely for several years building out their B2B\nportal and catalogs, to serve their global network of OEM (bike manufacturers),\nDistributors, and Retailers.

The company provides a wide range of investment management services,\nincluding mutual funds, retirement planning, and institutional investing,\ncatering to a global client base across various asset classes such as equities,\nfixed income, and alternatives.Managing and advising a portfolio of over $571bn\nworth of assets as of 6/30/2024, Allspring emphasizes a client-first approach\nand integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations into\ntheir strategies.**Allspring Global: A New Beginning** In November 2021,\nAllspring emerged as a standalone entity following its separation from a large\nfinancial institution. This marked the beginning of a significant digital\ntransformation aimed at establishing a distinct identity and enhancing client\nexperiences. Optimizely’s CMS played a pivotal role in this transformation.\n\nAs Tahmina Choudhury, Head of Client Journey Management Technology explained,\nthe transition and separation from its previous financial institution presented\nseveral challenges. The legacy systems, particularly a 20-year-old Java-based\napplication, created complexities in managing and transferring data to the new\nwebsite. Despite these hurdles, the primary focus remained on ensuring a\nseamless client experience and establishing a robust digital presence.**Why\nOptimizely/Separation from Previous Bank**\n\nAllspring underwent a nearly three-year transition to separate from its previous\nentity, focusing on building necessary systems from scratch while migrating\nlegacy systems to the cloud. This rapid, all-encompassing shift was unique in\nthe heavily regulated asset management industry, which typically moves to the\ncloud incrementally. Choosing a content management system (CMS) for Allspring\nwas challenging due to the stringent regulatory environment of the asset\nmanagement industry. In its previous guise, the company was restricted to using\nSDL Tridion with limited control, managed by an enterprise group.\n\nPost-separation, Allspring conducted a thorough RFP process in 2020, evaluating\nleading CMS platforms like Sitecore, Optimizely, and Acquia. The decision to\nchoose Optimizely was influenced by its cost benefits, flexibility, security\nfeatures, and integration capabilities. The transition allowed Allspring to move\nfrom a highly restrictive environment to a more flexible, cloud-based\ninfrastructure, enhancing their technological capabilities.\n\nWe have seen our web traffic increase significantly. Our financial advisors have\nalso received positive feedback from clients, with one stating, 'This is the\nbest site in the industry.' This acknowledgment is a testament to how well the\nnew site has been perceived within our industry.\n\nTahmina Choudhury\n\nHead of Client Journey Management Technology, Allspring Global Investments\n\n## **Utilizing Optimizely's CMS: A Strategic Move**\n\nAllspring undertook a comprehensive process to build its new website on\nOptimizely's CMS, focusing on enhancing the client experience and providing a\ndynamic, data-rich platform. The project began with a \"lift and shift\" of the\nexisting site from the previous infrastructure to Optimizely, despite challenges\nposed by legacy systems and ongoing data transitions. The redesign aimed to make\nthe site visually appealing and significantly increase data availability,\ntripling the amount of data displayed. This required extensive co-development\nwith expert partners Perficient to adapt to interconnected systems still linked\nto its former bank. Previously, the website hosted only a third of the data it\nnow holds. This expansion was crucial for a data-driven industry like asset\nmanagement.Launched in March 2024, Allspring’s new website is a dynamic and\nvisually engaging digital experience that better tells Allspring’s story and\nsupports its data-driven approach, showcasing their products and services\neffectively. Galliard Capital Management, a subsidiary of Allspring, also hosts\nits website on Optimizely’s CMS.Beyond the public-facing websites, Optimizely’s\nCMS was also utilized to create an intranet for internal communications. This\nintranet, named Springboard, facilitates resource sharing, departmental\ncommunication, and provides access to newsletters from the CEO. It serves as a\ncrucial communication tool for Allspring's employees, although plans for further\nenhancements are underway.**Content Management and Developer Efficiency** Prior\nto implementing Optimizely, Allspring's content processes were cumbersome and\nrequired significant developer intervention for updates and new content\ncreation. With Optimizely’s CMS, content authors gained more autonomy, reducing\nthe dependency on developers for routine tasks. This shift allowed the\ndevelopment team to focus on strategic integrations and improving the overall\ntechnology infrastructure.\n\nFrom a MarTech perspective, Optimizely has been a great tool for us. It has\nhelped us elevate our content management and digital experience platform to the\nlevel we needed. The ease of use for content authors and the seamless\nintegration capabilities have been significant benefits.\n\nTahmina Choudhury\n\nHead of Client Journey Management Technology, Allspring Global Investments\n\n## **Focus on Client Experience**\n\nClient experience is at the heart of Allspring’s digital strategy. The new\nwebsite design, with its dynamic content and personalized user journeys, aims to\ncater to various personas—from individual investors to institutional advisors.\nThe goal is to make the website intuitive and responsive to the needs of\ndifferent user groups, thereby improving user engagement and satisfaction.Since\nredesigning their website",

The new\nwebsite design, with its dynamic content and personalized user journeys, aims to\ncater to various personas—from individual investors to institutional advisors.\nThe goal is to make the website intuitive and responsive to the needs of\ndifferent user groups, thereby improving user engagement and satisfaction.Since\nredesigning their website with Optimizely, Tahmina Choudhury noted that\nAllspring has seen a significant increase in web traffic and received positive\nindustry feedback. Clients and industry peers have reported that the new site is\nconsidered one of the best in the industry. This recognition highlights the\nsuccess of the redesign and its impact on improving user engagement and\nperception.\n\n## **Technical Excellence with Optimizely’s CMS**\n\nOne of the standout technical benefits of Optimizely’s CMS is the control it\noffers over the tech stack. Developers at Allspring have leveraged features like\nSmooth Deploy to streamline deployments, which was not possible in its previous\nenvironment. The flexibility and control provided by Optimizely have\nsignificantly improved operational efficiency and allowed the team to implement\ncustom solutions as needed.\n\nOptimizely's focus on continually investing in its core CMS product gives us\nconfidence that it will remain a crucial part of our digital strategy. The\nplatform's ability to connect with various compliance and security tools makes\nit ideal for our needs as an asset management company.\n\nTahmina Choudhury\n\nHead of Client Journey Management Technology, Allspring Global Investments\n\n## **Development Workflow and Branching Strategy**\n\nAllspring's development workflow involves multiple environments: Development,\nUser Acceptance Testing (UAT), and Production. They use GitHub for code\nrepositories and GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, with plans to transition to\nJenkins, aligning with enterprise standards.For context, a branching strategy in\nsoftware development is a plan or methodology that developers use to manage the\ndifferent branches within a version control system like Git. Branches are used\nto develop features, fix bugs, or experiment with new ideas in isolation from\nthe main codebase. Allspring’s branching strategy was overhauled to accommodate\nhot fixes and feature isolation, preventing unready code from moving to\nproduction. This involved creating isolated branches for different features and\nhot fixes, which can be merged into the main branch once tested and approved.\nThis new strategy reduced the risk of deploying untested code and minimized\ndowntime.**Customizations and APIs**\n\nOptimizely’s CMS has been customized extensively to meet Allspring’s specific\nneeds. Custom APIs were developed for data integration, particularly with Unity\nfor fund data and an external data analytics provider for web traffic\nmonitoring. These custom APIs ensure that real-time data is available on the\nwebsite, providing users with the latest information.\n\nOptimizely is an ideal tool for us as it provided an easy-to-use platform for\ncontent authors while allowing developers to focus on integrations and add-ons\nrather than constant customization. The lack of infrastructure management and\nseamless upgrades were huge benefits, making it a great solution for our MarTech\nneeds and integration with other systems.\n\nTahmina Choudhury\n\nHead of Client Journey Management Technology, Allspring Global Investments\n\n## **Monitoring and Performance**\n\nAllspring employs Datadog for monitoring the health of their CMS and website,\ntracking key metrics like page load times and uptime. Optimizely’s CMS links\nwith an external analytics tool Allspring use for web traffic analysis,\nproviding insights into user behaviour and engagement. These tools help maintain\noptimal performance and ensure a high-quality user experience.**Security and\nCompliance**\n\nSecurity is paramount for Allspring, given its financial services background.\nThe CMS and website undergo regular security assessments, including dynamic\napplication security testing (DAST) to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities\nsuch as SQL injection risks. The use of Optimizely’s built-in security features,\ncoupled with rigorous internal protocols, ensures that Allspring meets its\ncompliance requirements.**Conclusion: A strategic partnership**\n\nAllspring’s partnership with Optimizely has been transformative, enabling the\ncompany to establish a robust and dynamic digital presence. The focus on client\nexperience, combined with technical excellence and strategic integrations, has\nset a strong foundation for future growth. As Allspring continues to evolve,\nOptimizely’s CMS remains a critical component of its digital strategy, ensuring\nthe company can meet the ever-changing needs of its clients.Allspring plans to\nenhance its digital ecosystem around Optimizely's CMS and the Optimizely One\nplatform. Having successfully redesigned their website, their next steps include\nintegrating a Digital Asset Management (DAM) system with Optimizely to\nstreamline content management. They are also selecting an accessibility vendor\nto ensure content complies with accessibility standards before publication.\nAdditionally, Allspring aims to implement an SEO tool and a translation vendor,\ncreating a seamless and efficient ecosystem centred on Optimizely to improve\ntheir operational efficiency and user experience.By leveraging Optimizely’s\ncapabilities, Allspring have not only navigated the challenges of transitioning\nfrom a large financial institution but has also positioned itself as a leader in\ndelivering exceptional digital experiences in the asset management industry.\n\n#### Industry\n\nFinancial services\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

They ask different functions to share their most\npressing customer challenges, and use this information to decide what\nexperiments to run. This direct input from the wider business ensures that Sky’s\nservice represents the true customer needs.\n\nThe experimentation team regularly visit Sky contact centres and sit with the\nteams taking calls from customers day in day out. By asking for agents' opinions\non what they should be doing to improve the offerings, the team can run\nexperiments on real time issues._**“No one knows more about customers than our\ncall agents, because they speak to them every single day. We always show the\nagents the tests that we’ve run and how they’ve impacted the customer\nexperience. Agents are excited about coming to us with ideas now because they\nsee how it all works. Everyone’s being brought on the journey.”**_ - Simon\nElsworth, Senior Experimentation Manager, Sky\n\nHaving the ability to demonstrate quantified value in experiments taken from\nideas from the business helps achieve buy-in from the wider organization, from\nthe executive team to contact centre agents. The experimentation team always\ncircle back to the teams submitting ideas to talk through the results,\nexplaining why certain ones worked, which didn’t, and what they learned.\nHighlighting the good results that came out of it and showing the agents how\nthey’ve impacted Sky is key to creating an empowering, innovative environment.\n\nThe differentiator for us is ensuring that we experiment our way to a better\ncustomer experience.\n\nAbdul Mullick\n\nHead of Digital Transformation, Sky - Best Digital Team - Customer Approach at\nDXA2019\n\n## Digital first mindset for all\n\nThe Sky experimentation team are working hard to build a culture of\nexperimentation across the business. When the team first started using\nOptimizely the main focus was to improve customer experience across all digital\ntouchpoints through the website, and other digital touchpoints more broadly.\n\nNow that experimentation is a standard process, it allows the team more time to\nthink about how to apply a multi-channel approach — and run offline\nexperimentations too. Simon and the team spend a lot of time identifying the\nadditional business functions which spend the most time interacting with\ncustomers, such as contact centres, and working with emerging technologies such\nas chatbots to provide these customers with a positive and personalised journey,\nwhilst encouraging them to move to a digital-first mindset.\n\n### What's next?\n\nSimon believes it is examining how industries should harness the power of\nexperimentation together. “Technologies like chatbots are a hot topic right now,\nespecially with the automation of everything, but what we really need is for\nindustries to come together to discuss experimentation. Are we all hitting the\nsame issues? Or the same positives? Talking about experimentation will allow us\nto make real progress with our innovations.”\n\nExperimentation is a key part of the fabric of the way Sky develops, and the\nsecret to having an award winning digital customer service.\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n- Feature Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.sky.com/",

From letters to packages, PostNord delivers items in all sizes to, from\nand within the Nordic countries.Its customer groups range from individuals to\nsmall, medium, and large enterprises, stamp resellers to PostNord agents.\n\nAlthough mail services are declining globally, PostNord remains integral in\nmoving the Nordic society forward. Festive seasons are the busiest times of the\nyear for PostNord. Not only is there a spike in package delivery, but PostNord\nalso experiences an increase in demand and site traffic from customers tracking\nparcels and purchasing its world-renowned stamps.\n\n## **Legacy systems and technical backlog cause customer dissatisfaction**\n\nPostNord had been experiencing issues with its online shop built on a legacy\nsystem of 20 odd years. PostNord’s various websites were constantly down from\nDDoS attacks prior to moving to Optimizely while customer expectations were also\nchanging.\n\nDue to the way PostNord’s sites were hosted previously, DDoS attacks on one\ncould affect all its sites, causing downtime across.When PostNord’s sites face\ndowntime, customer service receives a spike in calls from dissatisfied users.\nDespite mail services declining globally, PostNord’s users are still heavily\nreliant on functions including track-and-trace, parcel pricing, and timeline\nestimations.\n\nJames Robinson, Product Owner at PostNord, shared that the shop was also not\nresponsive and becoming increasingly harder to maintain.\n\nRobinson also shared that improvement efforts were hampered by siloed internal\nteams that did not have visibility across different functions. The PostNord team\nknew that starting on a clean slate would give PostNord the best chance at\ncatching up to its technical debt.\n\n## **Overhauling PostNord’s digital solution for a customer-centric experience**\n\nPostNord identified Epinova as its Optimizely implementation partner in October 2020. After a thorough analysis of PostNord, Epinova recommended Optimizely\nCommerce for PostNord’s situation. The PostNord team agreed as Optimizely is a\nrenowned platform amongst developers, ensuring longevity in its marketing tech\nstack.\n\nEpinova wasted no time helping PostNord migrate to Optimizely Content Management\nSystem (CMS) and later, with PostNord’s migration to Optimizely Customized\nCommerce.\n\nSecure sites helped PostNord tackle downtime issues and DDoS attacks, making its\nsites always on for users.\n\nThe PostNord team finds the suspicious traffic alerts from Optimizely highly\nvaluable as it acts as the first line of defense in maintaining a secure\nbrowsing experience for PostNord users.\n\nMoving to a CMS hosted on Microsoft Azure’s cloud computing platform has also\nchanged the way that PostNord work internally. Previously, PostNord’s large\ncross-functional teams found it difficult to resolve issues quickly both whilst\nworking with an on-premises solution and with its previous cloud platform\nprovider.\n\nNow, with the Optimizely’s cloud-based solution integrated with PostNord’s tech\nstack and digital services supported by Amazon Web Services, PostNord have a\nclear deployment pipeline from development all the way to production, allowing\nthem to deploy changes and updates faster than previously possible.\n\nWith Optimizely CMS, PostNord uses Recommendations and **Targeting** to create\nvisitor groups, delivering the most relevant experiences to its widely different\ncustomers. The PostNord team complements this with personalized landing pages\nusing Optimizely’s intuitive **Authoring & Layout**.\n\nThis resulted in PostNord providing a more customer-centric experience based on\na user’s profile, something it could not execute before Optimizely. From one\nURL, PostNord can customize its landing page and account login page for the\noptimum buying experience.\n\nTo cater to its plethora of customers from different countries, PostNord\nleverage Optimizely to make its websites available in various languages\nincluding Danish, English, Finnish, German, Norwegian and Swedish.\n\nRegarding PostNord and Epinova’s partnership, Robinson shared that Epinova’s\nscalable team has been critical in helping PostNord manage the backlog.\n\nWhen an unexpected request is included in the pipeline, Epinova always comes\nthrough in the clutch to ensure timelines are on track.\n\nWe've been on quite a transformational journey from being hosted on-premises to\nOptimizely’s cloud-hosted CMS and more recently, Customized Commerce to include\nour stamp shop. We’re now able to deploy faster and reduce unwanted incidents\nwith Optimizely raising alerts when suspicious activity happens. The team can\nthen work out if the traffic is legitimate and if it’s not, we can block the IP\naddress.\n\nJames Robinson\n\nProduct Owner, PostNord\n\n## **PostNord delivers on customer satisfaction**\n\nPostNord’s digital transformation was guided by one goal – to improve site\nuptime exponentially.\n\nWith Optimizely’s cloud hosting on Microsoft Azure, PostNord’s users can track\ntheir parcels from a secure site anytime, anywhere. This has increased customer\nsatisfaction and decreased customer service calls, as 90% of PostNord’s site\ntraffic is related to parcel tracking activities.\n\nThe PostNord team successfully freed up internal resources dedicated to handle\nDDoS attacks, saving costs and time.This has improved the work efficiency for\nPostNord developers.\n\nOne of PostNord’s most notable wins was its stamp shop relaunch on Optimizely",

The\norganization’s furniture and space solutions are designed to encourage wellbeing\nand productivity. Royal Ahrend operates in more than 20 countries, including\nChina, Russia and Dubai, through a portfolio of four well recognized brands:\nAhrend, Gispen, Presikhaaf and Techo.\n\nWith COVID-19 changing the way people work across the world, Ahrend noticed new\ndemands from its customers and needed to change its products and services\nquickly to adapt to the new reality.\n\nOne of the new services Ahrend has started to offer is its ‘working from home’\nproduct, designed for employees to pick their own home office furniture bought\nby their employer. The website authorizes them to pick what they require and the\norder is then sent to their home address. Ahrend provides all the communication,\nproduction and delivery of the goods, in a user-friendly, personalized and\nsecure way.\n\nThe organization also worked hard to identify and design customer journeys by\ncreating focus groups with its own customer journeys measuring customer data\nwithin certain digital touchpoints. This was done for both the traditional\ncustomer journeys (B2B) as well as the new (B2C) and retail journeys.\n\nWhen all of the customer journeys had been designed Ahrend needed the proper\ninfrastructure and platform to grow and realise the benefits of such a solution.\n\nBeing an Optimizely customer since 2012, it was an easy decision to build a new\nsolution with both Optimizely Content Cloud and Optimizely Commerce Cloud, these\nproducts were integrated onto a multi-brand platform servicing all customer\ngroups in one. Ahrend also implemented Salesforce as its CRM and is now\nintegrating all its systems into one seamless customer experience. The solution\nprovided a new way of doing business with its customers.\n\nA customer-specific web-shop with selected products or setups for working from\nhome solutions was set up , next Ahrend integrated the customer’s HR system with\na single sign-on that gives employees access to their employer’s catalogue\nwithout any account being needed other than the one they already use. Here, the\ncustomer can order from the selected catalogue and have the products delivered\nto their homes.\n\nRunning on the Optimizely DXP platform was a huge advantage, being compliant and\nsecure towards its customers as part of the solution and service.\n\nAhrend has become a truly data-driven company over the past few years where\ntracking results and using analytics has become an important part of the\nbusiness. Ahrend measures conversion, satisfaction and key touchpoints within\neach customer journey and uses these numbers to provide a better service and\ntweak the proposition for each customer. Ahrend also measures different ways of\nproviding the service which gives good indications which customer journey, or\npart it, works best and then adapts to the relevant services both online and\noffline.\n\nThe next steps for Ahrend are now to integrate all its systems into one seamless\ncustomer experience, resulting in an even more data driven business and\nextending this on both online and offline channels.\n\n---\n\n4NG - We grow digital business.\n\nWe help our clients growing their digital business based on digital experience\nplatform solution.

A manufacturer\nand distributor of complete boiler room solutions, Cleaver-Brooks develops hot\nwater and steam generation products aimed at integrating and optimizing the\ntotal boiler, burner, controls system to maximize energy efficiency and\nreliability while minimizing emissions.\n\nIn an otherwise declining market, Cleaver-Brooks has grown their business over\n20% in the last four years. Despite the fact that most companies have already\ninvested in boiler room solutions for their company, Cleaver-Brooks is still\nable to continuously grow their market share based on their promises of quality,\nreliability and world-class customer support.\n\nWhere there is success, there is opportunity. By listening to the market and\ntheir customer base, Cleaver-Brooks knew they needed to get more tools in place\nto take their business into the future. With ambitious aftermarket growth goals\nand a dedication to going the extra mile for customers, Cleaver-Brooks voyaged\ninto eCommerce.\n\n## Opening new channels and addressing new markets\n\nThree years before investing in eCommerce, Cleaver-Brooks’ rep network was their\nsole channel for part sales and estimates. While a reliable source, Cleaver-\nBrooks recognized that they were only reaching about 25% of the total\naddressable market and that eCommerce would open new channels and help them\nreach more prospects. To grow their aftermarket business, beat the competition\nand meet the needs of a changing buyer, Cleaver-Brooks needed a robust eCommerce\nplatform.\n\n**Selecting Optimizely Configured Commerce**\n\nFinding the right eCommerce platform isn’t always an easy task. To narrow their\nsearch, Cleaver-Brooks created an RFP and analyzed 12 different eCommerce\nproviders. The providers were measured against a Pugh Matrix created by Cleaver-\nBrooks’ IT, marketing and sales teams which helped them prioritize based on:\n\n- Implementation Total Cost\n- Maintenance/Ongoing Cost\n- Implementation Team\n- User Experience\n- Sales Analytics Capabilities\n- Functional Requirements\n- 3<sup>rd</sup> Party Add-ons Needed\n- Implementation Timeline\n- CMS Capability\n- Additional Sales Volume\n\nAfter creating their matrix, they applied a weighting system to each category\nbased on pressing needs and “must-haves” within the application. Ultimately,\nOptimizely B2B Commerce Cloud outweighed other eCommerce platforms and met many\nof Cleaver-Brooks’ requirements.\n\nOptimizely B2B Commerce Cloud was a clear winner from a business to business\nstandpoint. Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud met more eCommerce requirements than\nthe competition with features that came right out-of-the-box.\n\nMaxwell King\n\nVice President of Aftermarket Sales, Cleaver Brooks\n\n## The only OEM selling parts through eCommerce\n\nCleaver-Brooks is currently the only OEM selling parts through an eCommerce\nplatform. When you buy from Cleaver-Brooks, you know that you’re buying a\ngenuine OEM part that will fit your boiler. Customers are guaranteed the\nquality, performance and reliability they are used to because they’re not buying\na third-party knock-off.\n\nCleaver-Brooks makes this possible by being findable. If somebody has a specific\npart number or the name of a part, their eCommerce site can facilitate that sale\nand get the customer’s needs addressed faster than ever before.\n\nAfter launching their eCommerce site in October 2018, Cleaver-Brooks saw a\nsteady growth of adoption of the site, and an increase in returning customers to\nthe site. Customers can efficiently do their jobs with access to inventory,\ncustom pricing and easy online ordering.\n\nWith eCommerce launched, Cleaver-Brooks promises same day delivery to their\ncustomers through 3 p.m.\n\n## Leveraging the Optimizely platform\n\nCleaver-Brooks uses built-in B2B functionality within Optimizely to deliver\nsuperior customer experiences.\n\nCustomers can use “Find a Representative” tools to identify the closest Cleaver-\nBrooks representative partner.\n\nUtilizing out-of-the-box product detail pages, Cleaver-Brooks gives customers\neasy ways to quickly filter through product information and make purchases.\n\nIn an industry where most of their competitors are hiding it, Cleaver-Brooks is\nable to provide transparent pricing and real-time availability for their\nproducts.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://parts.cleaverbrooks.com/",

Learn more now.\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nRAKBANK, also known as The National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah, is one of the oldest\nand most dynamic banks in the UAE. Founded in 1976, the bank has grown to become\na leading retail and business banking provider, with over 19 branches across the\ncountry. RAKBANK offers a wide range of personal and business banking services,\nincluding treasury and insurance solutions.\n\nAs a customer-centric and innovative bank, RAKBANK is always looking for ways to\nenhance its digital capabilities and customer experience. However, the bank\nfaced some challenges with its website and digital marketing operations, which\nwere hampering its efficiency, performance, and growth.Teams were siloed and\ndisconnected within marketing. The bank's marketing team had to rely on multiple\ntools, documents and drives to collaborate on, store and share assets, resulting\nin a lack of visibility and efficiency.\n\nFurthermore, they were working on an outdated and slow CMS. The bank's website\nwas built on HCL, a legacy CMS that the bank had been using for 12 years. The\nwebsite had poor load times, limited functionality, and needed a tedious\nsyndication process for content updates.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, RAKBANK decided to look for a new CMS solution\nthat could meet its current and future needs. The bank wanted a headless CMS\nthat could integrate with its other platforms (such as its mobile app) and\nneeded a solution that could also support digital asset management, content\ncreation and campaign management. After evaluating different options, RAKBANK\nchose Optimizely as its digital partner.\n\n**Solution** RAKBANK partnered with Optimizely to implement CMP and DAM for its\ndigital and content marketing operations, and to migrate their website from HCL\nto Optimizely CMS. The bank also leveraged Optimizely's local support and\nability to ensure a smooth and successful transition.**Streamlining\nCollaboration and Content Operations**\n\nOptimizely CMP is purpose-built for marketers, which enabled RAKBANK to see\nimmediate value by adding structure to their marketing processes without\nrequiring heavy maintenance or training.Using CMP, RAKBANK can easily plan,\ncreate, and execute campaigns and content within a single platform, instead of\ndisparate tools, documents, and spreadsheets. Their marketing team relies on\nflexible workflows to assign campaigns and their supporting tasks and to check\nprogress. They’re able to collaborate on content and campaigns by having all the\nrelevant campaign information (and content creation) happening in one place.\nThis streamlined approach to content creation and execution in CMP has\ntransformed RAKBANK’s digital",

Optimizely CMP helps your team upscale their output. It’s a\nhighly positive experience when it comes to Optimizely\n\nVibhav Gaur\n\nVP of Media & Analytics\n\n## **Uplevelling RAKBANK’s Digital Presence with Headless Content Delivery**\n\nOptimizely's headless CMS allows RAKBANK to create, manage, and deliver\nexceptional content experiences across multiple channels, such as its website,\nmobile app, and social media. Migrating to Optimizely CMS also supplied faster\nload times (18% decrease in load time), easier content updates and more\nflexibility to choose the best implementation for each of their sites.\n\nTo further improve the visitor experience on their website, RAKBANK also\nimplemented the Search and Navigation add-on to Optimizely CMS. Using natural\nlanguage processing, the feature understands the topics that visitors are\ninterested in and provides them with relevant content recommendations. After\nimplementation, RAKBANK experienced a 6% increase in page views, a 37% increase\nin engagement time and an 8-12% increase in leads.Using Optimizely CMP and CMS\ntogether means that RAKBANK can use the publishing integration that connects the\ntwo platforms. This enables their marketers to plan, create and publish content\nto the CMS (via an embedded CMS editor), without ever having to leave the CMP.\nThis streamlined process empowers RAKBANK’s marketing team to make content\nupdates and get content to market faster by removing the dependency on technical\nteams and lengthy syndication wait times, ultimately reducing 9 hours per week\nof manual work.\n\nI think it's the Rolls Royce of the CMS and CMP domain, the world’s top-class\nsolution. It helps reduce your go-to market time drastically, which is critical\nwhen it comes to the banking and financial sectors. Making changes to our\nwebsite has been seamless. Highly effective.\n\nVibhav Gaur\n\nVP of Media & Analytics\n\n## **Using Integrated Asset Management to Get More Out of Their Content**\n\nAn essential part of the content process, Optimizely’s integrated digital asset\nmanagement (DAM) allows RAKBANK’s marketing team to store, organize, and manage\ntheir brand-approved assets in a central location. DAM also enables RAKBANK to\nseamlessly reuse and repurpose their assets for different campaigns and\nchannels, saving them time and resources.\n\nWith native capabilities like asset renditions featuring smart focal points and\nimage editing, RAKBANK can take a main file from their creative agency and make\nminor tweaks right within DAM, significantly reducing the time it takes to\nfinish assets.\n\nWith the goal of building a more connected tech stack, RAKBANK uses the\nintegration between Optimizely DAM and Optimizely CMS to create and deliver\nengaging content for their website and other platforms. Optimizely DAM is fully\nintegrated into the upstream workflows (content planning and creation) and\ndownstream workflows (delivering to any channel) in CMP, as well as Optimizely\nCMS, where assets can be pulled directly into webpages from the CMS interface.\nThis seamless integration enables RAKBANK to easily access and insert their\nassets into their webpages and get the most out of their content.**Next Steps**\n\nRAKBANK are not stopping their marketing transformation here. The bank has\nambitious plans to expand its use of Optimizely products and features to\ncontinue improving upon their digital experience, such as:\n\n- **Web Experimentation:** RAKBANK plans to use Optimizely Web Experimentation to test and optimize its website content and campaigns and deliver personalized experiences to its diverse and growing customer base. They already have a list of hypotheses and experiments planned, such as changing images, fonts, colors, languages, CTAs, lead forms, and QR codes.\n- **Integrations:** RAKBANK plans to explore the integrations that Optimizely CMS and CMP offer with other solutions, such as heat mapping tools, Google Analytics, Google Drive, their CRM and other data platforms. These integrations will help the bank to gain more insights and enhance personalization.\n- **AI:** They plan to take advantage of CMP’s innovative AI capabilities, including text and image generation, to help scale their content production efforts across various channels.\n\n#### Industry\n\nFinancial services\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Content Management System\n- Content Marketing Platform\n- Optimizely One\n- Web Experimentation\n- Digital Asset Management",

Simple changes such as updating images on the\nhomepage were unnecessarily complicated.\n\nIt did not help that the previous solution provider’s support had an\nunpredictable response time.\n\nThe search function was also chargeable for even the most minor searches\nperformed on the site, making it costly for IFPA to maintain the search function\nfor a better user experience.\n\nAs IFPA wanted to stay ahead of the technology curve, it also had plans to port\nover to a cloud-based solution, something it could not accomplish with its\nexisting CMS provider as it came at an exorbitant cost.\n\nThe team knew the shortcomings of a less than desirable website for both\ninternal and external stakeholders, so the main objective of the website revamp\nwas how it can make things better.\n\nA new website that encompasses the full extent of IFPA’s efforts was crucial to\ncommunicate to industry stakeholders and establish its identity as a critical\nindustry authority as well as provide visitors with a seamless user experience.\n\nThe task force assigned to the website overhaul was a lean team of five people\nand they had less than half a year to launch their new web presence as IFPA by\nJanuary 1, 2022.\n\nThe IFPA team assigned to this task had to ensure the following goals were\nachieved by January 1, 2022:\n\n- An up-and-running, visually appealing website that represented IFPA with essential pages\n- A CMS that will allow IFPA to create content with ease\n- At least six pieces of content that cover any of the IFPA’s 13 resource topics, spanning from advocacy to technology, live\n- Published content for global events that IFPA hosts annually\n- Allow IFPA members to log in and access members-only content\n\nThe IFPA team knew they could not pull this off alone. They started looking out\nfor a new CMS and experts that would help make their highly time-sensitive goals\na reality.\n\n## **Cultivating its identity as an industry leader – from the ground up**\n\nWorking closely with its members from a variety of groups including food safety,\nconsumer trends, floral, food service and sustainable supply chain management,\nIFPA collected holistic feedback to identify the best solution for its\nstakeholders.\n\nIFPA found Perficient, an Optimizely partner, and after a few helpful\nconversations with demos and examples, it landed on Optimizely being the best\nfit for IFPA’s needs – a flexible, intuitive, cost-effective, and frequently\nupdated solution hosted on the cloud.\n\nOnce the preliminary details were ironed out, Perficient and IFPA hit the ground\nrunning. Perficient took on the project management and worked very closely with\nIFPA to bring to life the ideal website that fits IFPA’s new identity through\nfrequent and open communication.\n\nThe vision for IFPA’s website is to become a source of authoritative information\nfor industry stakeholders. It wanted visitors to regard the website as a place\nto get the latest updates about the industry and improve site engagement through\nrelevant content.\n\nWith access to a rich pool of resources ranging from consumer to sales data for\nits industry, it was important for IFPA to give back to its community, so\neveryone stays up to date. It dedicated a section to ‘Resources,’ which included\narticles, industry updates, podcasts, press releases, virtual town halls and\nwebinars. The resources were presented in a structured manner with logical\nsearch and filter options by leveraging Optimizely’s Search & Navigation. The\nbest part? Search & Navigation is part of Optimizely’s solution and does not\nincur additional costs when site visitors use the search function.\n\nA section was also designated for ‘Events’ to keep industry stakeholders in the\nloop of the latest exhibitions, conferences and virtual events. This helps\nrelevant businesses prepare for upcoming events and gain exposure.\n\nIn addition, Optimizely’s intuitive and user-friendly CMS helped the IFPA team\nstructure and plan its content.

    "content": "# The Rank Group drives 134% increase in game launches\n\nThe Rank Group raises the stakes with experimentation and better uptake of safer\ngambling tools.\n\n## The gaming operator adopts a testing-first culture to minimize the risk of\n\nproblem gambling and improve the customer experience\n\nOver the course of more than three-quarters of a century, the Rank Group has\nentertained many millions of customers in Britain and around the world. Yet, the\ngambling industry has undergone significant changes in recent years, from\nmanaging regulatory and legislative reforms to handling the rise of the internet\nand the latest technology. The Rank Group has had to adapt quickly to stay ahead\nin the market.\n\nIt is for this reason that the company decided to work with Optimizely to revamp\nits digital offering. The Rank Group has been able to improve the customer\njourney to help people find the games they love such as simple game retargeting\nfor frequent customers, or showcasing new products like dual play Roulette game\nto Live Casino customers. Not only can The Rank Group improve the customer\nexperience, it can also do so in a compliant manner against new regulations\nensuring it does its utmost to be a responsible operator.\n\nMy entire team, which is made up of designers and developers, as well as\nanalysts and optimisation managers, values Optimizely’s platform very highly.\nBefore using Optimizely, we were tracking results manually which was not only\ndifficult but also unreliable. Now everything is a lot more accessible which\nallows us to demonstrate the real value of experimentation to the rest of our\norganisation, like never before.\n\nKerry Dawes\n\nDirector - Digital Customer Experience, The Rank Group\n\n## Being a responsible operator\n\nThe Rank Group’s ambition is to be the UK’s leading multi-channel gaming\noperator, which is why it takes its responsibility to customers so seriously. To\nachieve this goal, the company has to provide customers with not only\nexceptional experiences but also processes that help keep them safe from problem\ngambling.\n\nPreviously, the company had a range of ‘tools’ for customers to manage their\nplay, including deposit limits, set reality checks, take a break notifications\nand self-exclusion capabilities. Whilst these tools were available on the site,\ncustomers had to actively navigate the site to find them. To solve this\nchallenge, the company used Optimizely X Web Experimentation to discreetly\nexpose customers who, using predictive models, showed signs of being at risk, to\nthese options whilst they were online. This softer approach resulted in 10\npercent of customers who were exposed to these options each week, opting into\nthe responsible gambling tools to keep their play at safe levels.\n\n## Testing the power of experimentation\n\nThrough Optimizely’s platform, The Rank Group not only minimised the risk of\ncustomers developing gambling problems but also enhanced the user experience\nthrough reviewing other customer journeys on its site. Before Optimizely, the\nteam had launched a total of 100 tests, including 15 running on each brand at\nany one time, using a previous platform. This has now significantly increased,\nwith the team having launched 150 tests in just the last six months. These range\nfrom very complex retargeting and cross sell activities to simple tasks such as\ncolour changes, or changing the calls to action on the site. For example, by\ntesting three different colour variations with the Deposit button, the green\nversion was picked after successfully increasing clicks by 14 percent.\n\nPrior to working with Optimizely, the company rarely tested out smaller changes\nas the process took the same amount of time to do something small as it did to\nchange a complex test. As a result, complex tasks were prioritised and the\npositive cumulative impact of constant, small tweaks were missed. A good example\nof the impact this change has made is when the company recently tested a daily\nlive jackpot countdown which helped drive 134% in game launches from that\nparticular feed. Now, the company can go from the initial idea to building the\ntest in a matter of a few hours, meaning that The Rank Group never misses out on\na quick win.\n\nAs the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force, the company\nalso faced the challenge of how it could continue to interact with customers in\na way that suits their wishes. The team experimented with the preference options\nin an attempt to re-engage customers. The Rank Group trialled a pop-up on the\nwebsite asking people about their marketing preferences which saw 9 percent of\ncustomers opt-in to communications which the company now plans to roll out\nacross the different sites it owns.\n\n## Sharing the benefits of experimentation\n\nThe adoption of Optimizely within the business has been welcomed widely across\nvarious teams. From designers and developers to analysts and optimization\nmanagers, the ease of use has made a big difference to employees’ lives.\nImportantly, by using Optimizely’s Program Manager, the leadership team can view\nthe overall health of the programme and easily access progress. As a result,\nthis has helped strengthen the organization’s confidence in testing and has been\nintegral to spreading the culture of experimentation.\n\n## Looking to the future\n\nAs The Rank Group continues to register strong results, the teams currently\nworking with Optimizely will focus on implementing a testing-first culture which\nwill include getting involved in launching their own AB tests to sale the\nprogramme across the business. The next step for The Rank Group will be to fully\npersonalise the homepage for visitors to provide customers with a top class\nhighly relevant experience. The business looks set to continue cashing in on\nexperimentation.\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation",

In 2020, Cuisinart’s long-\nterm goal of adding direct-to-consumer ecommerce offering to their sales\ndistribution channels was expedited by COVID-19-driven store closures. Seemingly\novernight, Cuisinart needed to replatform their website and enable direct-to-\nconsumer online sales, while still supporting their important retailer\nrelationships – fast.\n\nCuisinart partnered with digital agency Whereoware and Optimizely to replatform\ntheir website in just six months, gain independent control of their product data\nand search engine optimization (SEO), drive business growth for their retailer\npartners, and support a robust DTC sales channel delivering the best possible\ncustomer experience to every shopper.\n\nTo future-proof the website for continuous growth, Cuisinart chose Optimizely's\naward-winning Digital Experience Platform (DXP).

The company\nmanages a staggering 1 million acres of residential and commercial countryside,\nrural land, and coastlines in England and Scotland, providing advice and\nexpertise to its clients centred around maximising opportunities in forestry,\nrenewables, and the sustainable environment sectors. Bidwells has a significant\npresence in the Oxford-Cambridge Arc (a high-growth economic area that supports\n2 million jobs and adds £110 billion to the UK’s GDP) and has grown to become\nthe largest property consultancy in the Arc region. Bidwells also acts as a\nconsultant to the government on developments and investments in the Arc region.\nThe company’s areas of expertise are science and technology, Oxford and\nCambridge colleges, land and estate, development, sustainability and\ninvestment.Due to its multidisciplinary nature, Bidwells works with its 130+\npartners to serve a variety of client types including developers, investors,\nlandowners and homebuyers.\n\n## Bidwells revamp online digital experience to reflect energetic company\n\nculture\n\nBidwells wanted a website that accurately represented its fun, energetic and\npassionate culture whilst providing its clients with a clear user journey based\non company type and easy-to-digest editorial content and advice. However,\nBidwells’ website redesign not only reflected a cosmetic facelift; it\nrepresented a Herculean internal cross-collaborative effort with the overarching\ngoal of a complete redesign of the company’s business and service offers.Digital\nMarketing Manager at Bidwells, Chelsea Jarvis, shared that its old website tried\nto cater to all customers on one single website. This resulted in diluted\nmessaging that focused more on describing Bidwells’ own services and internal\nstructures than its clients’ needs. It was pivotal that any new website clearly\nspoke a language that its customers could understand while reflecting Bidwells\nand its partners’ passion for their work. With its wide and varied consultancy\noffering, Bidwells aimed to ensure that its online digital experience clearly\nemphasised its service and value proposition to prospective customers and\nhighlighted success stories with its partners.One of the biggest pushes for\nBidwells’ digital transformation was the lack of visibility on its site visitors\nand how users interacted with its website. On Bidwell’s previous website, the\nteam had been using Google Analytics, which had helped them to capture basic\ndata and information about its users.However, Jarvis shared that the ideal\nBidwells website would provide a personalized digital customer experience and\nflexibility to make swift edits.In addition, Bidwells wanted a website that was\nextremely secure, not susceptible to security breaches and integrated well with\ninternal systems that housed information like customer data and internal\nproperty portals.\n\n## Building a customer-centric digital solution\n\nThe Bidwells team set out to look for its ideal digital solutions provider and\nnarrowed it down to Adobe and Optimizely.Bidwells held numerous meetings to\nevaluate its options. The team wanted to run more data-driven campaigns with its\nwebsite and realized Optimizely’s Digital Experience Platform best fit their\nneeds and requirements. Jarvis shared that the Optimizely team’s dedication to\nunderstanding Bidwells’ business needs sealed the deal for the Bidwells team.\n\nThe first order of business for Bidwells was to secure its website. The Bidwells\nteam achieved this with Optimizely’s partnership with Cloudflare, ensuring the\nreliability and security of its external-facing and internal resources. To\ntackle its diluted messaging, the Bidwells team leveraged Optimizely’s Visitor\nGroups to target website content to selected user groups. Bidwells customized\nits criteria for different persona groups and leveraged the geographic location\nfunction to personalize for its Scottish market. Unexpectedly, Bidwells\ndiscovered the potential of Optimizely Recommendations’ customer-first\ncapabilities in improving business operations. It decided to change its service\noffer to coincide with the launch of its website. The change meant Bidwells’\nmessaging and content spoke directly to the needs of customers instead of\nfocusing on its expertise. Once its website’s foundation was laid out, the\nBidwells team utilized the Optimizely Data Platform to harmonize customer data\nfrom different sources for a holistic view that guided their data-driven\ncampaigns.Bidwells selected Optimizely partner Novaspark to help with the\nimplementation of Optimizely’s CMS and back-end integrations needed to make the\nwebsite revamp a success. Novaspark’s team, led by CTO Stuart Toller, was\ncritical to Bidwell’s success, providing knowledge, guidance and support to the\nBidwells organization. The strong partnership built between Novaspark and\nBidwells allowed for continuous progress during the difficult COVID-19 period\nwhere communication and consensus on important decisions had to be executed\nremot",

The strong partnership built between Novaspark and\nBidwells allowed for continuous progress during the difficult COVID-19 period\nwhere communication and consensus on important decisions had to be executed\nremotely.Toller shared that Optimizely’s Multisite capability helped ease\nBidwells’ site creation workflow. The Bidwells team can quickly duplicate sites\nand easily edit based on individual site objectives. Bidwells now has three\nwebsites on the same code base hosted on the same platform, making integrations\neasier than ever. One of the three websites is Bidwells’ land and estate\nwebsite. As these customers are highly distinctive, it was of utmost importance\nto have a designated view of the site’s traffic and audiences in one place while\nensuring the messaging is tailored to them. Bidwells overcame the challenge of\nappealing to both B2B and B2C users by ensuring the content and navigation was\ntailored to their needs. Novaspark helped Bidwells implement the necessary\nintegrations to ensure that their Optimizely CMS neatly integrated with their\nother back-end platforms. Some integrations included Netsuite and Cascade as\nwell as other finance, supply chain management, HR, and location-related\nintegrations. From a developer’s standpoint, Toller shared that Optimizely’s\nuser-friendly interface made it easy for him and fellow developers to get work\ndone.\n\nCompanies like us that have multiple campaigns happening concurrently run the\nrisk of diluting the brand and messaging. By using Optimizely’s Visitor Groups\nand Recommendations, we can negate that risk.\n\nChelsea Jarvis\n\nDigital Marketing Manager, Bidwells\n\n## Bidwells’ successful bid at its digital transformation\n\nWhether it’s to nurture existing clients or win new clients, Bidwells reaped the\nbenefits of delivering personalized customer experience to different customer\ngroups with Optimizely. Despite varying concurrent campaigns, Bidwells\nsuccessfully delivered tailored content through a logical user journey without\nconfusing site visitors. By providing a unique digital customer experience to\nits residential estate customers, the team achieved its valuation leads goals by\nincreasing the number of leads while improving lead quality.The value of\nBidwells’ new and improved digital experience was not only recognized by its\ncustomers. In 2022, Bidwells’ website won the Best New Website category at the\nProperty Marketing Awards for their website.\n\n## Developing Bidwells’ digital estate to further business goals\n\nBidwells has plans to increase its £50m business to £70m by 2026. To achieve\nthis ambitious goal, Jarvis shared that the team plans to keep a finger on the\npulse of the ever-evolving MarTech space to further Bidwells’ digital\ntransformation. With support and guidance from trusted partner Novaspark,\nBidwells aims to maintain its premiere digital customer experience by continuing\nto enhance its website. Optimizely’s AI-powered Recommendations will play a\ncritical role in Bidwells’ 2023 digital strategy to improve site engagement\nthrough better content suggestions. The Bidwells team will also highlight its\ncapability to build needs-specific sites for its developers using Optimizely’s\nMultisite capability.

    "content": "# Mid Sweden University unifies digital channels onto one platform\n\nAccessibility and personalized digital teaching—both a given at Mid Sweden\nUniversity.\n\n## All digital channels—including public intranet—on one platform\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced many organizations to rapidly transform their\noperations from the ground up. Now that offices have been emptied and Working\nFrom Home is the new normal, digital tools are more essential than ever. While\nin many cases this has involved a dramatic transformation, Mid Sweden University\nis one of the exceptions, even in the world of academia.\n\nLong before the pandemic, a large proportion of its academic studies had\ninvolved virtual learning. Now almost half of the courses are taught virtually\nand several entire college programs can be studied remotely.\n\nThe Mid Sweden University web has a growing significance for its operations.\nOptimizely, is the engine for Miun.se, and a number of other conference and\nproject websites run by the university. Mid Sweden University has long been\nworking with the combination of Optimizely and Knowit as partners for web\ndevelopment and management. Working with Knowit involves skills benefits for Mid\nSweden University.\n\n\"External administration suits us very well. It creates clarity around\nrequirements and planning. We know what is being delivered and can work towards\ndeadlines,\" says Bengt Nilsson, web coordinator and digital strategist at Mid\nSweden University.\n\nThe latest major changes include a redesign of the website and moving the\nstudent portal (previously located on another platform) to Optimizely.\nMeanwhile, Miun.se has moved to the cloud via the Optimizely Digital Experience\nPlatform. For Mid Sweden University, gathering almost all content on the same\nplatform, while enhancing and consolidating the user experience, involves\nobvious synergies. The image archive has also moved to the cloud via the\nImageVault media management system, which acts as a media bank for storing and\npublishing all types of media files.\n\nThe new website also reflects the university’s commitment to transparency.\nAlmost all pages on the intranet—over 98%—are freely accessible, which is the\nwhole idea.\n\nWe want to publish everything covered by the principle of public access to\nofficial records. Requiring login to access information that should be in the\npublic domain would serve no useful purpose.\n\nBengt Nilsson\n\nWeb Coordinator, Mid Sweden University\n\n## The student experience central to MSU's move to the cloud\n\nMid Sweden University has been preparing for the transition to the Optimizely\nDigital Experience Platform for a long time. A deciding factor for the move was\nthe prospect of an even more reliable web. Accessibility requirements have\nalways been high, something that is underlined when all web-based services are\non the same platform. With the cloud offering, capacity can also be scaled\nquickly as required. Traffic to Miun.se is noticeably seasonal, with a strong\nincrease during the college application period in the spring, when the number of\nvisitors to the education pages multiplies exponentially.\n\nThe Mid Sweden University websites cover about 7,500 pages in total and more\nthan 100 people work with the content in various editorial roles. Alongside\nMiun.se, which accommodates the external web, student and employee portals,\nabout 15 project and research websites occupy the same platform.\n\nPersonalization is central to Mid Sweden University’s efforts to continuously\nimprove the online experience. It is already providing personalized information\nto its employees and is working hard to provide this to its students as well.\nThe ultimate aim is a personal startpage with information retrieved from various\nsources and displayed: calendar, email, schedule, bookings and exam results.\n\n## Central management of images and content\n\nOne complementary solution that Mid Sweden University has been using alongside\nOptimizely for a long time is the ImageVault media management system, which\nkeeps track of some 25,000 images belonging to the university. The latest\nversion of ImageVault is also cloud-based, which gives access to new AI\nfunctions (via Azure AI) and enables automatic tagging of images, for example.\nImageVault has also been equipped with built-in automation for scaling images,\nwith adaptation to different devices and the connection in question.\n\nThe immediate goals for the Mid Sweden University web manager mainly concern\nincreasing accessibility, for example through new solutions for visual\ndescription and automatic subtitling of videos. In this context, it is worth\nnoting that ImageVault has new video functionality.\n\n#### Industry\n\nEducation\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.miun.se/en/",

    "content": "# Distributor Corporation of New England sees 200% increase in AOV\n\n## A pioneer in innovation and technology since 1963\n\nDistributor Corporation of New England (DCNE), a second generation family-owned\nbusiness, is one of the largest distributors of commercial and residential HVAC\nequipment, parts and supplies serving Eastern Massachusetts, Maine, New\nHampshire, and Rhode Island, with 6 branches throughout their territory. As the\nNew England distributor of Carrier equipment and parts for close to sixty years,\ntheir mission to continue exceeding customer expectations has never wavered.\nThey strive to inject value in the channel wherever and whenever possible.\n\nDCNE’s customer-base is made up of mechanical and HVAC contractors. Their\nproduct catalog includes everything ranging from residential and commercial\nheating and air conditioning equipment, commercial applied equipment for large\nindustrial buildings, and a full line of parts and supplies.\n\nDCNE is highly respected by fellow Carrier distributors around the country and\nis considered a pioneer in innovation and technology. Through eCommerce, DCNE\nset out to bring their complex business online to meet evolving customer\nexpectations and stand out in a competitive market.\n\nFrom turnkey to robust eCommerce\n\nDCNE launched their ecommerce journey in 2012 with a turnkey, off-the-shelf\necommerce solution. It was low cost and delivered what they needed at the time.\nEventually DCNE realized it had outgrown the solution, and they knew it was time\nto search for a new ecommerce platform that overcame the limitations of the\noriginal solution, which included:\n\n- Outdated architecture\n- Lacking features\n- Reliance on developers to make simple changes\n- Little to no integration to third party tools\n- Content issues\n- Not scalable\n\n## The hunt for the right fit\n\nDCNE considered over 30 different ecommerce platforms during their initial\ndiscovery phase. There were a lot of small, turnkey solutions like the one they\nwere already using, or full enterprise grade solutions that were too far out of\nreach. They needed something in the middle, built for the complexities of B2B.\n\nEventually DCNE decided to move forward with Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud\nbecause the platform was built for B2B and had robust integration capabilities.\nDCNE knew Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud would meet their complex pricing needs\nwith integration to their Infor ERP.\n\nOptimizely B2B Commerce Cloud has a ton of strong B2B features right out-of-the-\nbox. The platform solves very complex challenges and enables us to better serve\nour customers.\n\nBill Fiore\n\nDirector of Operations , DCNE\n\n## Getting buy-in for eCommerce\n\nThe initial investment for ecommerce and PIM may have been a sticker shock for\nDCNE at first, but they knew their long-term viability was predicated on\ninjecting value in the channel, and that they had to own ecommerce. They could\nnot afford to rely on a third-party developer’s roadmap or somebody else’s\ncontent.\n\nFor DCNE, introducing ecommerce was never about eliminating jobs. In fact, when\nthey planned for ecommerce, they knew it would help to create even more jobs and\nenhance and streamline the way in which the sales force and sales support\nassociates would serve their customers.\n\nWith the help of Absolunet, an end-to-end eCommerce agency, DCNE assembled an\necommerce team and identified their ecommerce requirements. When prioritizing\ntheir ecommerce requirements, DCNE considered impact, cost and complexity of\neach of the features. After about 10 months, they were ready to launch their\nsite.\n\nTransformational results and high praise\n\nDCNE’s ongoing investments in eCommerce have gained major industry recognition\nincluding being publicly referred to as the “Amazon of HVAC” by Supply House\nTimes. DCNE’s site search tool is among the best in the industry.\n\nEach piece of large equipment and all the tools and parts (including items that\nmust be backordered) are listed and available for purchase on their website.\nSalespeople and customers are now saving time through DCNE’s modern quote\nmanagement dashboard. The customer portal is a one-stop-shop for the majority of\ninteractions.\n\nSales representatives can easily go in, create a proposal, and forward it along\nto the customer. Once the customers are ready to place their orders they can\nsimply click, accept, and check out. Additionally, they can easily choose the\nclosest warehouse to pick up orders and receive status notifications on their\norder. DCNE also provides helpful recommendations of associated products to\ncustomers at checkout and all online promotions.\n\nEcommerce has even enabled DCNE to break down walls and divides that previously\nexisted in the company. Traditionally, DCNE had separate sales teams for\nequipment and parts. The problem was the equipment team never felt comfortable\ntalking about parts and conversely the parts team was not comfortable talking\nabout equipment. With ecommerce, that division no longer exists. More of DCNE’s\norders include equipment and parts because there is no divide, and sales\npersonnel are more empowered to sell the entire breadth and scope of products.\n\nIn addition, many sales representatives have years of knowledge with DCNE’s\nproducts and can recall certain product SKU’s off the top of their heads. DCNE\nneeded everyone at that knowledge level. It once took six to twelve months to\ntrain a new salesperson; however, with ecommerce DCNE has been able to cut\ntraining time in half!\n\nOn DCNE’s original platform, ecommerce sales were around 2.5% of their total\nsales, with 8,000 SKUs represented online. Today DCNE is marching toward 30%\nonline by the end of 2020 with more than 115,000 SKUs populated on the site.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nDCNE’s main goal is to drive as much business online as possible.

The company is an industry-leading lawn, garden and outdoor\nliving products and services giant with a passion for natural and organic\nproducts.\n\nHaving been in business for over 150 years the brand is synonymous with the\nworld of garden and lawn care. Scotts Miracle-Gro employs 6,500 people and has\nbeen listed in the Forbes top 100 in recent years.\n\nThe team at Scotts Miracle-Gro wanted to collect first-party data to grow its\nconsumer database and made the bold move to launch its first ever Super Bowl\ncommercial in 2021. The aim was to specifically collect email addresses and\nphone numbers to start an SMS programme over six weeks between January and\nMarch.\n\nWe knew Optimizely would be the best partner because they have the existing\ntechnology: All our existing customer data is stored in the Optimizely Data\nPlatform, and so are all the channels we need.\n\nAmanda Scarnechia\n\nCRM Marketing Manager, Scotts\n\n## Sprinkling of miracles\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro teamed up with Optimizely to deliver the ‘Dream Lawn and\nGarden Giveaway’, a digital sweepstakes for participants to win a cash prize\nplus other services from the company. The Optimizely Data Platform powered the\nmanagement of campaign flows through SMS and email automation during the Super\nBowl consumer journey. Through the text-to-subscribe system the business was\nable to manage product data and related digital assets while enforcing data\nconsistency across the digital campaign. ODP handles proper SMS opt-in\nprocesses, ensuring that clients are always compliant to privacy laws and\nregulations\n\nThe Optimizely Data Platform provided the functionality to create rich, and\ninformative digital experiences for consumers taking part in the sweepstakes. It\nhelped detail prizes, offers and reminders for those taking part, all while\ncapturing important first-party data ranging from the name, address of the\nconsumer to more open-ended results such as areas of interest.\n\nScotts Miracle-Gro took advantage of adding custom fields for the participants’\ninterests, and branched the automation flow based on their selected interest.\nCustomers are now getting other SMS and MMS messages, and their team is using\nthis channel regularly alongside email communications.\n\nData curation was at the very heart of the campaign objectives so ensuring the\ncollection of critical data before merchandising online was a major reason that\nOptimizely PIM was the solution of choice.\n\nThe campaign was measured by hard and fast metrics. The objective was to collect\nemail addresses and phone numbers and grow the database. This was a huge success\nwith over 300,000 new SMS subscribers and also growing the consumer email\ndatabase by 27.3 percent.

In order to scale, GSC needed to implement a new\necommerce platform to improve online shopping experience for customers and make\na bigger footprint in the digital space. Finally, they had to obtain support and\nadvice from a Dynamics AX and Optimizely expert to assist in critical projects\nthat would fuel future growth.\n\nGardener’s Supply Company needed a digital experience that would allow them to\nincrease their online presence, attract and retain new customers, and deliver\nexceptional service.

The aim was\nto create the same exceptional and personalized experience achieved in its books\nfor each online visitor. Specifically, Wonderbly wanted to be able to harness\nthe data that would best help move visitors through the funnel, generate higher\nconversion rates and inform critical decision-making.\n\n## A clear demonstration of business value\n\nOver the last 9 months, Lost My Name has developed and run over 50 unique and\non-going A/B tests using Optimizely. One A/B test looked at targeting customers\nthat were considering purchasing personalized books for children whose names\nonly had three or four letters.\n\nPrevious feedback and conversion rates had suggested that these customers didn’t\nsee the value for money when purchasing books as they thought the stories would\nbe too short, compared to those purchasing books for children with longer names.\n\nLost My Name ran a test with Optimizely that involved displaying a message for\nthose purchasing books for shorter names, explaining “short names don't mean\nshort stories, we've added 4 additional pages to your book”. While this\nparticular test had no impact on conversion; a deep dive analysis revealed\nparticular promise for just three-letter names with a very successful A/B test\nto follow.\n\n## Results\n\nThis additional test for just three-letter names surfacing the same message\nresulted in a proof of the initial hypothesis and an uplift in order conversion.\n\nTom Waterfall, Director of Conversion Rate Optimization, Lost My Name, comments,\n“Despite no impact on conversion being achieved for the four-letter test, the\nthree-letter test confirmed the initial hypothesis and resulted in 18.1% lift in\norders for visitors arriving via Facebook ads.

A practical guide\nto building an impressive site.\n\n## Digital Flexing\n\nServing over 100,000 members with a goal to promote better physical therapy, the\nAmerican Physical Therapy Association, APTA, play a vital role in the\nadvancement of physical health.\n\nAPTA was on a mission to create a new digital experience for its members by\nimplementing new user functionality and piecing together a powerful content\nplatform that could support their large membership base. It was down to\nOptimizely’s Gold Partner, Blend Interactive, to ensure the implementation took\nplace successfully.\n\nTaking existing design mocks, requirements, and technical specifications, Blend\nwas tasked with creating a full technical plan — essentially, a blueprint for\nthe Optimizely installation. They set about this through an iterative scoping\nproject, where requirements were spelled out a bit at a time and prioritized for\nboth budget and minimum viable product.\n\nThe goal was to keep surprises to a minimum by providing ongoing updates to the\noverall budget and decisions that might affect that budget.\n\n## Partnership Through a Dream Team\n\nBlend was provided early-stage strategic direction by APTA’s agency-of-record,\nbut this wasn’t a case of simply following directions. The three parties were\nunited and engaged toward interpreting that strategic direction in a way that\nworked best with APTA’s new Optimizely install. Throughout the project, Blend\nprovided expertise in concert with the marketing goals and editorial\nexpectations of APTA’s team. Wireframes were reviewed with Optimizely’s\ncapabilities in mind and adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Flexibility Through Product Ownership and Iterative Training\n\nIterative scoping and development is more than just following a document — it\nalso requires an organic look at each phase. The implementation process includes\nongoing training. Rather than train in one big chunk at the end, training was\nspaced in the attempt to provide all of the pieces to create specific sections\nof the site instead of everything at once.\n\nOptimizely Content Cloud provides APTA the scalability to reach more members via\na digital platform that’s inclusive to all. The platform delivers capabilities\nthat enables the team to monitor content performance for its audience.\n\nWhether it's upcoming events, courses or educational content, the site serves as\nan important engagement hub for the organization and its audience.\n\n#### Industry\n\nEducation\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.apta.org/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nBlend Interactive, Inc.\n\nBlend is a web strategy, design, and development firm based in Sioux Falls,\nSouth Dakota, and built upon a set of strong values.",

The RAS was founded in 1822 and is a not-for-profit\norganisation committed to supporting agricultural development and rural\ncommunities in New South Wales and across Australia.\n\nThe RAS’ mission is to foster innovation, sustainability, and excellence is\nachieved through a diverse range of initiatives and educational programs. These\ninclude well-known annual events such as The Sydney Royal Easter Show, which\nalways attract a diverse audience.\n\nVarious charitable initiatives are also supported through the RAS Foundation.\nThese are mostly focused on those that benefit rural and regional areas,\nprimarily in NSW.\n\n**A new focus on digital channels**\n\nAn organisation only manages to celebrate its 200 year anniversary by being able\nto progress with changing times. One of the steps that The RAS took to mark the\nevent was to create a new Head of Marketing role, which was filled by\nexperienced sales and marketing professional Frances Jewell.\n\nFrances told us that she soon identified the need to place a new focus onThe\nRAS’ online presence. Till that point, the website had not been seen as a\npriority, and had bounced from one internal owner to another with little proper\nattention and inconsistent management.\n\nThe RAS had been using Optimizely for some time, and although it worked well,\nFrances saw at once that the organisation could be getting much more out of it\nwith a little focus and some upgrades. In particular, she observed that the\nsystem was cumbersome in adding new content. Similarly, finding relevant\ninformation and buying online tickets was unnecessarily complex and there was\nclearly the potential for this to be detrimental to fundraising efforts.\n\nFrances stated that authoring new content had been a slow and tedious process.\nShe and her team realized that in order to remain competitive in the quickly\nchanging digital environment and provide an engaging user experience, it was\nnecessary to progress and catch up. After conversations with Sudo Roux, Frances\nobserved that the website had been stagnant for seven years, its lack of modern\nfeatures causing frustration among users and staff alike who had encountered\nobstacles.**Perfect partners with the right tools**\n\nArchitected by Gold Optimizely Partner Sudo Roux, who is also a recipient of the\nCustomer Choice Partner of the Year award. Frances commented that Optimizely has\nalways stood as a “true strategic partner” and The RAS had no interest or reason\nto look anywhere else when it came to upgrading the system\n\nSudo Roux were the missing piece that's been absent before. A full-service\noffering consisting of ‌customer-centric and value-led strategic insights,\nsupport, and guidance that align with a joint roadmap and its overarching\nbusiness objectives. Upgrading to CMS 12 was the foundations the business needed\nto stay true to the roadmap that Sudo Roux and The RAS had planned. With the\nadditional performance that CMS 12 offers, it means The RAS can at last offer\nthe sort of digital infrastructure that both internal and external stakeholders\nneed.**Transitioning to CMS 12**\n\nThere is always some concern when it comes to change, and some stakeholders\nwithin The RAS had reservations about shifting to CMS 12. There were the natural\napprehensions about potential disruptions to business continuity and whether the\ntransition would impose an additional burden on the team. However, the pain\npoints with the existing system had become so self-evident that there were no\nreal arguments against an upgrade and most understood that the need was\npressing.\n\nLed by Sudo Roux, the RAS gained a comprehensive understanding of how the\nupgrade would directly satisfy their critical needs. Consequently, the decision\nto upgrade became essential, as it would bolster security, enhance website\nspeed, and help retain valuable staff.\n\nCMS 12 was able to deliver distinct improvements over the legacy system. These\ninclude faster page loads which will immediately serve to reduce bounce rates\nand increase site engagement. Specifically, response time is around four times\nfaster while key actions like login and search are five to ten times faster. CMS\n12 has tripled its server handling capacity, resulting in an enhanced customer\nexperience during peak tariff periods of the Sydney Royal Easter Show, with up\nto 24 million users.\n\nAs well as the improved performance, CMS 12 has new features that add up to a\nbetter user experience for everyone, from content authors, developers and, most\nimportantly, the visitors. Content authors and editors benefit from an updated\nuser interface, inline block editing, different page view modes and a larger\ntext area, all of which make content creation and editing easier and faster.\nLikewise, there are enhanced features for developers that make the environment\neasier to work in and bring new efficiencies. **Demonstrable improvements across\nthe board**\n\nThe benefits of CMS12 sound great in theory, but it takes a real world case\nstudy of the software in action to see the tangible benefits that they can\ndeliver to a business.\n\nFrances commented that once the migration was complete, the one factor that was\nimmediately obvious was how much time could be saved. She said she saw an\nimprovement in team efficiency when it",

She said she saw an\nimprovement in team efficiency when it came to content authoring and editing.\nThe content authoring time has been profoundly reduced, thanks to the updated\ncontent management features. Sudo Roux didn't only think about the end user\nexperience but also the editors experience - after all, they're using this every\nday - This streamlined experience and process frees up time for team members to\ndevote to other strategic initiatives. It also ensures that fresh and relevant\ncontent is delivered in a timely manner\n\nAs well as the benefits for the content editors, Sudo Roux's development team\ncan deliver their update much more efficiently. The enhanced capabilities of the\nframework allow developers to write cleaner and more concise code, significantly\nreducing the overall time taken in development cycles. Not only does this mean\nnew features and functionalities can be delivered faster, it also delivers cost\nsavings by achieving the same development goals in fewer labour hours.\n\n“As a result,” said Frances, “we can keep our website dynamic and engaging,\nreflecting the latest developments in the agricultural industry and catering to\nthe diverse interests of our stakeholders.\n\nFrances has been pleased to witness significant improvements in UX, too. The\nfaster load times are, she said, palpable, and the enhancements in IA provide a\nmore cohesive browsing experience for users. Sudo Roux's UX and IA workshops\nexplored all factors that impacted the websites, such as analytics data, user\ninterviews, user behaviour, and business operations. This allowed for the\nwebsites to be streamlined and unnecessary components to be removed. This\nresulted in a more intuitive navigation and improved content discovery.\nUltimately, users now have a better experience than before, which is beneficial\nfor everyone involved. These workshops not only streamlined the websites, but\nalso improved the user experience, resulting in a win-win for everyone involved.\n\n**A game changer for RAS and its customers**\n\nFrances has described the upgrade to Optimizely CMS 12 as a \"game-changer\". She\nsays it has helped to set The RAS apart as an industry leader. In any business\nsector in the 21st century, speed and agility in delivering marketing\ncommunications is a core ingredient for building recognition and achieving\nsuccess. The RAS’ marketing team can react swiftly to emerging events and update\ncontent in minutes, ensuring that they stay responsive and demonstrate they have\ntheir finger on the pulse. It also positions The RAS in people’s minds as a\ndynamic and forward-thinking organisation.\n\nThe RAS, in partnership with Sudo Roux, has taken a transformative journey that\nhas changed them from a technological follower to a leader. With the support,\nexpertise, guidance, and assurance of our Gold level Partner, The RAS is well-\nequipped to future-proof their digital infrastructure. The framework is designed\nto be adaptable to future technology and industry standards, making any future\nupdates and maintenance simpler to manage. The RAS is confident that, with the\nhelp of Sudo Roux, they will be able to future-proof their digital\ninfrastructure for years to come.**Looking ahead**\n\nThe transition to CMS 12 is a vital stage in a broader project within RAS to\nimplement a Customer Centric Digital Experience Platform (DXP). This project is\nat the core of the company’s strategy, designed to transform customer engagement\nand to make life easier and better for staff and contractors.\n\nAlongside Sudo Roux, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Marketing\nAutomation (MA) systems are also undergoing major enhancements, all aimed at\nmaking customer interactions more personal and the marketing team more\nefficient. The company has also not ruled out exploration of CDP investment as\nan innovative component to the DXP.\n\nThe RAS plays a vitally important role in educating everyone on matters of\nagriculture and sustainability. Topics that are more important today than ever\nbefore. Optimizely and Sudo Roux are proud to play a role as a key strategic\npartner in helping The RAS to get its message across and to remain the leading\norganisation in this important sector for the next 200 years or more.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Commerce Connect\n- Content Management System",

To survive the economic effects of the great depression,\nMr. Weil sold the business to Max Mayer, who renamed the company Mayer Electric\nSupply.\n\nMr. Weil, who continued to manage the business and thanks to Mr. Mayer, was able\nto re-purchase the company in 1934 keeping the Mayer name. In 1979, Patsy and\nCharles Collat, Mr. Weil’s daughter and son-in-law, purchased the company and\nthrough their hard work, leadership and vision, the company grew to a leader in\nthe electrical distribution industry.\n\nToday, Mayer is one of the nation’s largest wholesale distributors of electrical\nproducts and equipment serving contractors, industrials, OEMs, integrators,\ninstitutions, government entities, utility providers, commercial businesses and\nresidential customers. With over 65 locations across 12 states, Mayer is defined\nby its connected team, unrivaled service and innovative solutions.\n\nWe wanted a platform that did not hold us back and was ready to innovate along\nwith us. We have not hit any limitations with the Optimizely platform.\nEverything we want to do is within reach. B2B Commerce Cloud has accommodated\nnumerous customizations and integrations\n\nKevin Gustin\n\nDirector of Marketing, Mayer\n\n## An industry leader in an increasingly digital age\n\nMayer is a regional powerhouse whose leaders are influential in the electrical\nindustry. In fact, Mayer’s president, Wes Smith is also Chairman of NAED\n(National Association of Electrical Distributors). As a leading voice in the\nindustry, Smith shares his visionary perspective on the digitalization of the\nelectrical industry. Mayer is part of leading organizations like IMARK Group and\nutilizes the electrical industry’s leader for digital product content, IDEA.\nMayer prides itself on giving back to the industry and acknowledging the\nchallenges that electrical distributors face in today’s digital-first world.\n\nAs a leader and innovator in the industry, Mayer was an early adopter of\necommerce. Mayer had outgrown their original ecommerce platform and was ready to\nmigrate away from it.\n\nWhile Mayer prides itself on being a visionary leader in the industry, the\nprevious site no longer evoked that sentiment. Mayer required a site that\ndifferentiated them from the competition and provided a user experience that was\nconsistent with what customers have grown to expect from Mayer.\n\nMayer has long term, generational relationships with their customers. When their\ncustomers interact with Mayer, they can expect unrivaled service. However, over\ntime, the online experience was becoming more disconnected from the offline\nexperience. They wanted to represent themselves online, the same way their\nassociates do in-person.\n\nOther pitfalls of the previous platform included a less than one percent\ncustomer adoption rate, an outdated user interface, lack of enriched product\ninformation and little to no ability to personalize the experience.\n\nMayer set out to modernize the brand experience, improve the backend integration\nand scale their product catalog to include partner brands and suppliers’\nproducts. They wanted to transform from a distributor with an online presence,\nto a distributor with an evolutionary, best-in-class ecommerce presence.\n\n## Finding a best-in-class B2B ecommerce platform\n\nUpon establishing the need for a replatform, Mayer’s Executive Vice President\nand Chief Digital Officer, Barry Carden formed a team of Mayer associates that\nincluded ecommerce, product and marketing expertise to assess and select a\nplatform.\n\nMayer’s ecommerce team had a variety of criteria to make the selection:•\nCustomization • Backend integration to their ERP, JD Edwards• Integration to\ntheir product information sourced from IDEA/DDS• Scalability• High quality\nsearch • Implementation partner network\n\n## Optimizely and implementation partner, Xngage up-level Mayer’s ecommerce\n\noffering\n\nMayer selected Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud due to its hyper-focus on B2B and\nnative capabilities that covered major gaps that were needed to support their\nstrategic direction including capabilities for search, CMS, personalization,\ncustomer segments, promotions and a mobile app.\n\nMayer went live on Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud in July 2020. Since then,\nthey’ve enjoyed much more control over the look and feel of the site, enhanced\nsearch and more sophisticated integration that enables the flow of important\ninformation into the site.\n\nUnder the guidance of Optimizely’s implementation partner, Xngage, Mayer was\nable to successfully bridge integration between multiple systems including their\nERP and product feed. Mayer is harnessing multiple technologies to deliver a\nseamless experience to their users.\n\nThere are thousands of details to manage in order to overhaul an electrical\ndistribution website. Xngage led a ground-up rebuild of the existing Mayer site\nflawlessly. All the content and product information on the website was brand\nnew, refreshed and rebuilt.\n\n## Mayer’s new site differentiates them from other electrical distributors\n\nMayer associates, suppliers and customers have provided unanimous positive\nfeedback about the upgraded site.\n\nAssociates can leverage the website to help improve the sales process. It was\nnever designed to replace the sales process, but rather supplement it. In\naddition, Mayer’s marketing team can easily customize landing pages, product\ncatalogs and content for each supplier leveraging the built-in B2B Commerce\nCloud CMS.\n\nCustomers now enjoy more information at their fingertips than ever before.

Ultimately he chose the Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud\nsolution for a few key reasons:\n\n- Customer success model rather than support agent\n- Admin Console built with the business user in mind\n- Rich B2B features built-in\n- Fully functional mobile app\n- Fully managed SaaS based solution\n- Customizable to meet the design needs of Consolidated\n- Easily integrated with Consolidated’s Eclipse ERP\n- Robust content management system\n- Custom pricing and catalog capabilities\n- Enhanced search capabilities\n- Focus on complexities of B2B\n\n## A complete paradigm shift\n\nAt Consolidated Supply, it was never just about an eCommerce website. It was\nabout changing the way the company did business for the better. Consolidated\nSupply has always done whatever it takes to best serve the customer, even if\nthat means making significant changes.\n\nThe Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud was able to meet 85% of Consolidated Supply’s\ncore B2B requirements right out-of-the-box. After launching the website,\nConsolidated saw an increase in registration, self-service activities and\nproductivity of their team members. Customers now have 24/7 access to pricing\nand availability of Consolidated’s products.\n\n## Product content as ecommerce fuel\n\nConsolidated Supply leverages the AD eContent Service to provide the product\ncontent fuel to the B2B Commerce Cloud engine. This enables Consolidated’s\ncustomers to find what they need to find and build confidence in Consolidated’s\nproducts. The AD and Optimizely partnership enables Consolidated to increase\ncustomer self-service, take care of their own needs and power their sales team\nto focus on completing high value tasks through ecommerce.\n\n## Increase in efficiencies and adoption\n\nSince implementing Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, Consolidated Supply has seen\nan increase in customer satisfaction, online ordering and team efficiencies.\nLess than one year after implementing InsiteCommerce, the amount of online\nregistered users doubled. Moreover, 18 months from launch, online registered\nusers increased by 157%.\n\nConsolidated recognized that eCommerce wasn’t just a project. It wasn’t\nsomething they would deploy then move away from. After the initial launch,\nConsolidated was receiving feedback from customers about certain struggles and\nquestions with the website.\n\nThree months after launch, the company set out to hire two Digital Engagement\nSpecialists (DES) solely dedicated to building a better eCommerce website.\n\nThe DES interact directly with customers, utilizing feedback from employees and\ncustomers to improve the website and create a user-friendly experience that\npromotes efficiency and growth with Consolidated’s customers. The DES are\nfocused on managing and assisting users with Consolidated’s website and mobile\napp and are yet another example of Consolidated’s continued focus on delivering\nextraordinary service.\n\nThe team implemented weekly “Engagement Metrics” tracking that produces an\nEngagement Rank for every customer. Ranks include: Super, High, Standard, Low\nand Not Yet Digital. Since hiring the DES, Consolidated has seen more than 10\ntimes growth of super users. In addition, Active Ordering customers (those that\nhave ordered multiple times in the last 90 days) has increased by 146% since the\nDES began.\n\nConsolidated Supply is delivering on the promise of extraordinary service with a\nfully functional eCommerce solution, and a dedicated team focused on continuous\nimprovement of the site. It’s a technology-meets-human solution. And it’s\nsetting up Consolidated Supply to serve their customers for the next 90 years.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.consolidatedsupply.com/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nXNGAGE\n\nXNGAGE is a Digital Services firm focused on delivering Commerce Success in B2B\nfor leading manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers.",

The organization provides\nassurance, tax and advisory services to privately held businesses, public\ninterest entities, and public sector entities.\n\nGrant Thornton needed to improve the performance of its multi-lingual, multi-\nmarket Optimizely site, add new features and improve search functionality. The\nsite needed to be accessible at high speeds from any of Grant Thornton's\nimportant markets around the globe, but its site speed score of about 40-50\ndidn't meet that requirement. In addition, the client required support for new\nlanguages and wanted to integrate a new section for gated content.\n\nOptimizely was used to dramatically improve the website’s performance.\nOptimizely partner, Niteco integrated Google’s Natural Language machine learning\nengine so that Grant Thornton’s entities around the world could use natural\nlanguage processing for Chinese, Japanese and Korean. This engine enables\nfeatures like sentiment analysis, entity analysis, entity sentiment analysis,\ncontent classification and syntax analysis.\n\nOptimizely outfitted the website with a separate section for gated content. As\nthe company works with a myriad of clients globally, having relevant documents\nand files readily available from anywhere is imperative. To top it off, Niteco\nfimplemented Content Security Policy to enhance the site’s security and help to\nreduce Cross-site scripting (XSS) risks.\n\nUnhappy with the search functionality on its site, Grant Thornton also asked\nOptimizely to give its integration a boost. Optimizely did so by adding Find\nAuto-Boosting, which allows for the prioritisation of certain search results\naccording to age and/or popularity. Optimizely also integrated Find Best Bets,\nwhich allows search administrators to promote selected content, which will then\nappear on top of other search results.\n\nFinally Optimizely built an entirely new Lucence index that works together with\nthe EPI Find index. This guarantees that the site’s availability always stays\nabove 99%.\n\nGrant Thornton International now enjoys a website that has an improved site\nspeed score of over 80, up from 40-50.\n\nThe improved search functionality makes for a more efficient user experience for\nGrant Thornton’s many clients who can now also easily and securely access gated\ncontent.

As an early adopter of eCommerce, First Supply originally\nran Infor Storefront to power their online customer experience. However, the\nplatform was not meeting the needs or expectations of their customers.\n\n## Adapting to a changing industry\n\nTo be in business for more than 100 years, you have to be doing something right.\nFirst Supply has always listened to the needs of their customers and adapted\nalongside an evolving industry. First Supply recognized that customers were\ngoing online to research products and that they valued experience-driven\napproaches. First Supply quickly realized that in order to stay in business and\nthrive for the next 100 years, they had to invest in eCommerce and build a team\nto champion it.\n\n## Midwest values and strong work ethic shines through\n\nFirst Supply set out to find an eCommerce partner to help them get started.\nOriginally, First Supply was attracted to Insite Software (acquired by\nOptimizely in December 2019) because the company’s Midwestern values matched\nthose instilled in First Supply since their inception.\n\nOther important eCommerce requirements for First Supply included:\n\n- An intuitive administration console\n- A branded mobile app\n- Built-in integration to InRiver PIM\n- Multi-site capability\n- Robust analytics and powerful dashboards\n- Deep B2B experience\n- Analyst-validated platform\n- Customer-specific pricing\n\nIn addition to First Supply’s ecommerce requirements, they wanted a partner that\ncould work closely with AD (Affiliated Distributors). Leveraging AD’s eContent\nsolution allowed them to focus their efforts on site development and\nimplementation, which meant they were able to launch more quickly with a\ncomplete product offering. Together, with AD and Optimizely, First Supply knew\nthey could take their business to new heights and compete with big players.\n\nI’ve worked with vendors and companies where you are just a number. That’s not\nthe case with Optimizely Configured Commerce. We have provided recommendations\nthat end up on the product roadmap. It’s a true partnership and the team makes\nus feel valued.\n\nTim Winter\n\nDirector of eCommerce, First Supply\n\n## Selecting Optimizely\n\nFirst Supply selected Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud because it met all of First\nSupply’s unique eCommerce requirements with native B2B functionality.\n\n## Customers are raving about firstsupply.com\n\nSince implementing Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, customers are extremely\nsatisfied with First Supply’s digital experience. Customers now enjoy 24/7\naccess to First Supply’s product catalog at their fingertips. They are able to\nself-serve and discover products they didn’t even know First Supply offered.\n\nFirst Supply continues to receive customer feedback and the results are\noverwhelmingly positive. Customers most enjoy real-time inventory by warehouse,\nthe ability to access their order history and customer-specific pricing.\nCustomers are enabled online and their jobs are easier than ever.\n\nFirst Supply is seeing four times more active users on the new website compared\nto when they were leveraging Infor Storefront. In addition, February 2020 sales\nwere up 47 percent from the previous year. Gross profit and average order value\nhave also increased.\n\nApart from the statistics, First Supply has also seen incredible business value\nout of eCommerce. The team is much more efficient. Sales representatives are now\nbeing freed up from mundane tasks like taking phone calls and checking order\nstatus. Today, they have the ability to add more value.\n\n## Offering continued education and training\n\nFirst Supply is focused on helping their customers understand the tools\navailable to them. From the eCommerce website to the mobile app, they are seeing\nhigh adoption across the board.\n\nConsidering First Supply has been around for more than 100 years, many of their\ncustomers have been doing business with them for decades. Even long-term\ncustomers who are more used to traditional forms of communication, are excited\nand happy with the tools available to them.\n\nFurthermore, First Supply has launched a social media campaign to promote\nadoption of the site. They offer their customers “Pro Tips” about the site to\nhelp them navigate the online ordering process.\n\nThe eCommerce team is also offering the First Supply sales team support and\neducation. Many salespeople in B2B roles across various industries tend to see\neCommerce as their competition.

    "content": "# Childline, NSPCC helps kids speak out and stay safe\n\nThe Childline website launched in UK primary schools in September 2018 and is\nnow promoted to young children alongside the helpline . Performance monitoring\nassesses the impact on helping younger people speak out while keeping them safe\nfrom abuse online.\n\n## A monumental shift in online safety for all children across the UK\n\nThe NSPCC is the leading UK charity concerned with the fight against child\nabuse.\n\nChildline work tirelessly to provide free and confidential support to young\npeople, 24/7. They joined forces with NSPCC in 2006 with the sole focus of\nproviding counselling services on a variety of sensitive topics from bullying to\nsexual abuse and relationships. The largest audience for Childline is 12-18 year\nolds, with content on its website created to instil self-resilience and\nconfidence in young people.\n\nDevoted to helping children of all ages, Childline promote their services to\nunder 12s through the ‘Speak Out, Stay Safe’ school programme, supported by\ncontent on the NSPCC website. However, with content written primarily for an\nolder audience, NSPCC recognized the need to improve the experience for a\nyounger age range.\n\nNSPCC appointed Optimizely partner, Netcel to advise and plan on how a website\npersonalization strategy might be employed to protect younger Childline\naudiences from more mature content, without alienating older users. A core aim\nof the project was to encourage under 12s to call the Childline helpline rather\nthan self-help. Additionally, it was important to fully integrate content and\npromotion of the Childline website within the Speak Out, Stay Safe programme\nwhile reducing concerns from parents and teachers over the nature of the content\ndelivered.\n\nThe first challenge to overcome was the best means of identifying a website\nvisitor’s age and an important question was raised around whether visitors\nshould be allowed to self-select their age. However, it was decided that simply\nasking them wouldn’t be effective enough, as research showed that some children\nmight lie about their age.\n\nThrough initial workshops, Netcel walked through the art of the possible,\nutilizing Childline’s personalization capabilities within Optimizely, the\nwebsite’s Digital Experience Platform. Beyond Optimizely’s inbuilt\npersonalization engine, Netcel explored the possibilities of direct questioning,\nprogressive profiling, search terms, safe headers, AI Chat and identifying\nschool IP address.\n\nWhile each solution was reviewed for their merits, no silver bullet existed to\naccurately identify a visitor’s age.\n\n## In charge of their time online\n\nTo overcome this challenge, Netcel recommended an layered approach where users\nwould register for a My Locker (website user) account, utilizing a link from a\nspecific referred domain and self-select their age, thereby reducing the risk\nassociated with safeguarding young people under 12. Different URLs were provided\nto KS1 and KS2 age groups to ensure that the website only delivered age\nappropriate content and messaging. A hierarchy of messaging was also set to\nencourage the young person to make contact or take action such as speaking to a\ntrusted adult, calling Childline, or finding advice and information across the\nsite.\n\nThe second challenge was to consider how and to what extent the content could be\nadapted for the younger audience. With limited research and insights available\non the under 12s audience, we devised a user engagement plan to be carried out\nin schools as part of a normal school lesson. The insights gleaned supported and\ndirected decisions over user experience and NSPCC’s subsequent content creation.\nImportantly, as a result of the personalization consultancy, Netcel could advise\non the optimum technical implementation, ensuring the investments made within\nthe Optimizely solution were maximised.\n\n#### Industry\n\nCharity and non-profits\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nNetcel Ltd.\n\nOptimizely Customer Choice Partner of the Year 2023 and 2022 Netcel is a leading\ndigital product consultancy and Optimizely specialist, combining our passion for\ndigital experience and the full end-to-end...",

    "content": "# Greater Bank increases page views by 238.6% with personalisation\n\nGreater Bank creates a market-leading solution for its customers with the help\nof experimentation and personalised content.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- Call Center experienced no calls to the call center or walk-ins to the branch on the day the new website went live, as customers could now easily self-serve\n- 167% increase in page views to the Home Loans section and a 465% increase in Savings Account content due to personalisation and content recommendations\\*\n- Saved 920 wasted hours a year due to improved workflow alone\n\nGreater Bank is an Australian customer-owned bank and mutual financial\ninstitution with headquarters in Newcastle, New South Wales. Specializing in\nfinancial services for over 70 years, Greater Bank has 260,000 customers and\nover $7 billion in assets under management.\n\n## Project objective\n\nGreater Bank is in the process of rolling out a major digital transformation in\nthe form of a market-leading mobile app and online banking platform for its\ncustomers. Once complete, the innovative solution will re-invent the online\nbanking and mobile app experience for users.\n\nAs part of the process, Greater Bank decided it would concurrently replace its\nwebsite Content Management System (CMS) and rebuild the customer website and\nmobile app. This was to enable the creation of consistent experiences from the\nwebsite into online banking, including the mobile app. The new CMS would improve\nworkflow and efficiency, such as the ability to preview website content before\ngoing live, assign responsibility and control of content, and provide a\nstreamlined production process. The outcome eradicated an estimated 920 wasted\nhours a year due to improved workflow alone.\n\nAdditionally, Greater Bank wanted to improve the digital customer experience and\nprovide bespoke and personalized content, via content recommendations and\npersonalization for customers.\n\nQuote Block (New): New Block\n\n## The solution\n\nAfter an extensive sourcing process, Greater Bank and their digital partner\nFusion selected Optimizely’s platform as the best solution.\n\nOptimizely’s Content Cloud was one of the very few solutions that had the\nability to execute all of Greater Bank’s requirements. It also enabled the\nimplementation of personalization features across digital assets, and Greater\nBank appreciated how their technology and IT teams would easily be able to use\nthose features.\n\nPowered by AI learning capabilities, Optimizely's platform is able to deliver\nreal-time content recommendations to users, along with a personalized journey as\nthey navigate through the website or mobile app. For example, users visiting the\nwebsite today that happen to be researching home loans, would be greeted by\nrelevant products and content if they returned to the website tomorrow and\nreceived a completely personalized home loan experience.\n\n## **The results**\n\nOptimizely’s platform along with Fusion’s experience in human centered design\nhas helped Greater Bank create a market-leading solution for its customers. The\nultimate measure of the success achieved from the project was evident on the day\nthe solution went live; the bank’s contact center didn’t receive a single call,\nnor did the branch experience walk-ins about the new website – the solution was\nso intuitive and user friendly that customers were able to quickly and easily\nself-serve.\n\nTwo of the major benefits the bank is experiencing since adopting the Optimizely\nsolution are the advancements in content recommendations, as well as the inbuilt\npersonalization for delivering content to its customers. Also, solving other\nissues around workflow and production pain points.\n\nDue to the implementation of Optimizely, various teams across the business are\nnow benefiting from a number of improvements. Content recommendations, content\npersonalization, and the ability to update the website in real-time have\nresulted in the business meeting all of its pre-project objectives.\n\n“Optimizely is a solution that’s powerful enough to enable and support such a\nhuge transformation, but simple enough to be easily used by the whole team,”\nsaid Craig Newham, Group Executive Sales Marketing & Distribution at Greater\nBank. “Both the Optimizely and Fusion teams have helped make all this possible,\nand because of that, we have seen incredible outcomes at Greater Bank”.\n\nAs a key contributor to this transformation project, Optimizely’s solution\npartner, Fusion has helped Greater Bank continue their mission to put the\ncustomer first.\n\n“In the highly regulated industry of Financial Services, it’s extremely\ndifficult to differentiate parity products. Delivering a compelling customer\nexperience is the only way to create a sustainable competitive advantage. How do\nyou achieve this outcome when the majority of customer interactions are via\ndigital channels?” said Damien Mair, Founder and Director at Fusion.\n\n“Simple. You personalize the digital experience. For over six months, Fusion\nworked intimately with the Greater Bank team, to strategize, design and\nimplement a highly personalized ‘digital branch’ built upon the foundations of\nthe Optimizely platform. Taking advantage of Optimizely’s experimentation and\ncontent recommendation tools, Greater Banks’ hyper-personalized digital\nexperience is continually delivering outstanding business results. There is a\nbig pay-off to being digitally personable”.\n\nFusion was able to provide improved speed to market for Greater Bank by using\ntheir Digital Branch Product, powered by Optimizely. Working alongside the\nGreater Bank and Optimizely teams, Fusion reached a production deploy in just\nthree months. In addition, Fusion integrated Optimizely’s Content\nRecommendations product that has provided additional value for Greater Bank and\ntheir members.\n\n“Greater Bank has a great team that understands and anticipates the digital\nneeds of their members. Their passion, experience and collaboration helped\nFusion deliver an experience their members love,” said Mair.\n\n## **The metrics**\n\nSince launch, the Greater Bank team has been able to easily and successfully\nlaunch a dozen personalization experiments via the Optimizely platform,\nincluding the imminent full personalization of the bank’s homepage.\n\nSince launch",

They must demonstrate due diligence in\ntheir selection of suppliers. Being the sole government body for the county, the\nteam has an obligation to provide the highest quality services, to the greatest\nnumber of citizens, within stringent budget allocations - so they don’t burden\ntaxpayers.\n\n‘’everybody wants a better service and to do this we need better technology. We\nhave to figure out how to implement some of these newer technologies into what\nis obviously a very old business’’\n\n## Creating disruptive, positive change against the status quo\n\nOne of the greatest challenge’s Government authorities face, is the ability to\nchange at the pace of their service-user’s expectations - especially in the\nadoption of better technology. However, this is difficult with a three-year\ncycle from ‘decision-to-implementation’ the norm.\n\n## ‘’Nobody wants to be first – everyone wants to see a proven solution’’\n\nWith the exciting opportunity for change, Waukesha County ignited a movement to\nmodernize their digital capabilities. They challenged the status-quo, opting for\na digital transformation that would better serve their public and internal\nteams.\n\n## Meeting the needs of over half a million people\n\nFollowing a consultation it was decided the time had come to modernise Waukesha\nCounty’s internal and external websites to create a better way of communicating\nwith the public effectively and offer the town’s citizens a better service.\n\n‘’Ektron wasn’t a long-term solution. We had to get off the older technology on\nto the newer’’\n\nEngaging with as many people as possible, Waukesha County collated thousands of\npieces of feedback from various stakeholders. They had taken onboard a broad\nsubset of expectations, eventually having to reign in on a compromised solution\nthat would satisfy the majority.\n\nWe changed the game in how to communicate with the public on an almost\ninstantaneous basis.\n\nDave Kragenbrink\n\nSolutions Administrator, Waukesha County\n\n## Implementing Optimizely to provide superior engagement capabilities\n\nWaukesha County chose to migrate their digital platform from the existing Ektron\nplatform to Optimizely. This enabled them to embrace newer technologies that\nwould better serve its internal and external stakeholders.\n\nWith the Optimizely CMS having advanced functionality that was simple to\nmaintain, the County described Optimizely as a “liberating platform” that\nenabled it to upgrade a lot of its function items and deliverables.\n\n## The Optimizely upgrade\n\nWaukesha County converted its external and intranet sites from Ektron to\nOptimizely, deploying Optimizely CMS for its new interface. The intranet site\nwas a complete site redesign, in addition to changing the back-end. Essentially\na brand new Optimizely site was built from scratch and replaced the old\nsite.Optimizely was able to leverage some functionality that the local\ngovernment didn’t currently have with its site and gave the opportunity to\nupgrade lots of functional items and deliverables. It was able to build tools\nbased on customer expectations and ongoing customer feedback as opposed to just\nadding things from a ready-made list.\n\n## Efficient user-journey’s\n\nFor 2018, Waukesha County recorded 3.3m page views on its external website with\n2.3m unique visitors. In January of 2019, 180,000 visitors were recorded.\n\nThe goal of the new interface is to deliver visitor information as quickly as\npossible. Visitors tend to want one thing at a given time before exiting the\nsite.\n\nOptimizely Find was is an extremely powerful tool for Waukesha, aggregating\ninformation quickly, so user journeys remain quick and efficient.\n\nOptimizely CMS has allowed data visualization to become the norm for internal\nand external stakeholders. Integrating with Power BI, users can view graphic\nillustrations such as customer satisfaction levels and recycling rates.\n\n## Positive outcomes\n\nInitial site feedback has been extremely positive. External users have reported\nthe site is much easier to navigate and more desirable. Those inside the\norganization have said the site is a stark difference to how it was with some\ndescribing it as ‘fresh and clean’ and ‘exactly what was needed’.\n\nContent editors have expressed positive opinions on the usability of the media\nmanagement of the site and stakeholders are enjoying the platform which is\nempowering them in their different business units. The site sees more\ninformation being posted and much more valuable information being posted because\nit is very easy to do.\n\nWaukesha County is always looking at future options for improving both sites and\nexpanding their functionalities. It is considering Optimizely Commerce for\ntaking payments in the future and integrating its document management system.\n\n#### Industry\n\nTech\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

    "content": "# Experimentation helps RB hit the spot with its Durex customers\n\n## Experimentation helps RB hit the spot with its Durex customers\n\nReckitt Benckiser (RB) is a British, multinational consumer goods company,\nproducing health, hygiene and home products. It is made up of a growing\ncommunity of 40,000+ diverse, talented entrepreneurs – all driven to make the\nworld a happier, healthier place. They draw on each other’s skills, working\ntogether, to help make people feel better. Through research and development, RB\nmakes better products that empower everyone to take their health into their own\nhands and homes. The company’s power brands, such as Nurofen, Strepsils and\nDurex are sold in 180 countries. The organization uses Optimizely Web\nExperimentation across its UK Durex sites, as a part of the company’s global\ncommitment to experimentation.\n\n## Using experimentation to understand audience preference\n\nRB’s goal in the UK was to increase the number of sales across the full range of\nDurex products on their online portals. Headed up by Amy Vetter, RB’s European\nConsumer Experience Manager, Direct To Consumer, the team first ran surveys to\nestablish customer pain points and identify areas for testing. The team also\ntook inspiration from what other successful brands were doing, and if they saw\nsomething they liked the look of, it was flagged and became another area for\nexperimentation. Optimizely’s functionality facilitated these tests by allowing\nthe team to run several versions of a page or customer journey across multiple\nregions at once. They could then test and measure responses before committing to\nlong term changes. This proved particularly useful, as some of the strategies\nthat they thought might work, actually proved a miss with Durex customers in the\nUK, and they were able to shift focus accordingly.\n\n“Optimizely is one of the easiest tools to pick up and learn. Within two days I\nwas up and running and had the first test going.”\n\nAmy Vetter\n\nEuropean Consumer Experience Manager, Direct To Consumer, Europe, Reckitt\nBenckiser Durex\n\n## All that glitters is not gold\n\nAn example of this came when the team decided to test out whether they would get\nbetter traction using a younger, Kylie Jenner (Kylie Cosmetics) style navigation\ntechnique, which would showcase Durex’s best sellers or favourites. The\nimplementation of this actually saw a 6% decrease in revenue, leading the team\nto realize Durex customers preferred to shop by category, rather than by\nperceived best sellers or favourites. Another test they tried was a burger menu\non desktop, similar to Kylie Skin, which actually saw a 7% decrease in revenue\nover a 2 week period. Being able to test ideas like this, and quickly change the\nlayout or design if it’s not resonating with consumers, is one of the benefits\nof experimentation and learning from the failures is arguably as valuable as the\ntests that do work out.\n\nEqually, when the tests have gone well, the results have proved fruitful. For\ninstance, it was realized that the messages put out on the Durex site needed to\nbe short and sweet, no matter the offer. There was a whopping 32% increase in\nproduct page visits and 6% increase in revenue, in just one month, when using\nshorter lines rather than longer brand messaging headlines. The team also found\nthat having the offers page a different color to the navigation, increased click\nthroughs by 11% over a 10 day period.\n\n## Amazon approach not hitting the spot for customers\n\nHaving the ability to test like this also helps to categorically prove or\ndisprove assumptions. Just because you might find something easy, engaging or\nappealing, doesn’t nessasarily mean others will. This has been true for the\nlatest test that the team has run on the Durex site, which saw them adopt an\nAmazon style, bundle package option. The idea being that if a customer had\nselected one Durex product, that they would usually have to pay an additional\n£4.99 postage fee on, a bundle option of other relevant products would be\nsuggested to them. This would then take them over the threshold for free\ndelivery, whilst also suggesting other products related to their initial\npurchase. However, 1% fewer people actually added anything to their cart when\nfaced with this bundle option and the average order value was 1% lower, with\ntotal revenue down 6%.\n\nIt is clear that the bundles are not working as it stands, so the next phase in\nthe testing process will see the bundles being changed out for different\nproducts, to see if that increases interest. Being able to test and learn like\nthis, has helped the team to understand the Durex customers better, providing\nthe team with the ability to react quickly to what works well and change\nanything that doesn’t hit the spot.\n\n## Sharing the benefits of experimentation\n\nHolding on to successes and learnings that these tests had produced, wouldn’t\nimprove the RB business overall, so the team wanted to ensure that the rest of\nthe business could benefit from their findings. Leading the charge, Amy started\nproducing weekly presentations of their learnings, sending them out across the\nwider business. Other departments saw the results of the tests the team had been\nrunning, and decided to initiate their own experiments in response.\n\nThese successes and learnings gave the Durex team widespread visibility, and\napproval from senior management at RB, which has resulted in them pushing the\nexperimentation envelope even further. To elevate RB’s experimentation program\nto the next level, they are now looking at multi-variant testing",

Working with offshore tech support\nwas also challenging for the team.\n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, Torrco knew it needed to upgrade its ecommerce\nplatform to meet the expectations of digitally savvy customers, but its ideal\nsolution would require expertise with best practices and a roadmap of\nimprovements to meet the constantly evolving needs and business models of its\ncustomers.\n\nNot knowing where to start was one thing. The Torrco team was also aware that\nthey may not know what they do not know, causing blind spots in the process of\nbuilding their ecommerce platform.\n\nA holistic view of customers throughout the user journey was also something\nTorrco wanted to gain insight into through its ecommerce platform. This required\nmultiple seamless integrations.\n\nDespite mostly serving B2B customers, Torrco was also aware that its customers\nwanted to have a B2C-like online experience. This was an important aspect of its\nbusiness but was uncharted territory for Torrco.\n\n## **Taking a customer-centric approach**\n\nThe search for a fitting solutions provider and partner was on and Torrco landed\non Optimizely and Xngage, an Optimizely partner.\n\nWith Optimizely’s intuitive and forward-thinking interface coupled with Xngage’s\nunderstanding of Torrco’s mission, Torrco’s ideal ecommerce solution started\ntaking shape.\n\nThe process started with integrating Torrco’s ERP system with Optimizely’s PIM\nto provide customers with real-time updates on product data, pricing and\ninventory availability – both online and at specific Torrco locations. The up-\nto-date information also empowers employees who are assisting customers via\nother channels accurately.\n\nA redesign that’s familiar to Torrco’s customer base was implemented for the\nwebsite to help visitors find what they are looking for swiftly and improve site\nfunctionality. This redesign of Torrco’s site navigation ensures a frictionless\nsearch experience, drawing on the best practices of leading B2C platforms with\nclearly segmented categories, rich product information and intuitive checkout.\n\nIn addition, customers are able to log in and access account-specific\ninformation including order management, purchase history and quick checkout.\n\nWhile Torrco strives to build and deliver a seamless B2B buying experience to\nits customers, the team understands that some customers prefer an omnichannel\napproach to interact and transact. Torrco helps these customers by providing\nthem with the necessary information including physical locations and contact\ndetails clearly on the website.\n\nSince Torrco got the ball rolling prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was able to\ndouble down on its efforts in improving user experience with the foundation laid\nout. Torrco’s website served as an integral point of contact for customers who\nwere looking to get in touch, purchase or research products.\n\nThe strong working relationship between Torrco and Xngage as well as\nOptimizely’s exceptional B2B capabilities helped shape Torrco’s new and improved\nwebsite that exceeds customer expectations.\n\nIt's so important to have a partner like Optimizely out in front for us because\nwith all these things like machine learning, artificial intelligence, search\nprogramming, these things are constantly changing.\n\nDon Polletta\n\nVice President, Sales & Marketing, Torrington Supply Company (Torrco)\n\n## **Torrco’s pipeline to success**\n\nWith Torrco’s customer-centric approach to its website, especially with\nintuitive site navigation and convenient product search, it came as no surprise\nthat its user experience improved.\n\nSince the new website’s launch using AD enhanced eContent, Torrco’s number of\norders increased by 10% while number of lines per order increased by 35%. Torrco\ncustomers are placing more orders as well as purchasing more items in each\norder.\n\nBy partnering with AD eCommerce Solutions, Torrco has an integrated and enforced\ncontent strategy with over 20,000 normalized and attributed SKUs. With AD’s\nstrategic partnership with Optimizely, Torrco leverages the AD Optimizely\nConfigured Commerce to aid in the ongoing ingestion of their enhanced SKU\ncatalog directly from the AD Member Product Information Management (PIM). In\naddition to the AD enhanced eContent, Torrco leverages the AD member-driven\nproduct classification taxonomy to drive the best digital customer experience.\nTorrco continually maintains their SKU catalog by taking scheduled updates from\nthe AD eContent service on a weekly basis freeing up resources to no longer\nspend time on classifying products and populating product attributes.\n\nIn addition, Torrco has also seen an increase in customer logins online as\ncustomers are provided with more ways to get in touch with the team.

As a result, customers are also kept up to date with\nTorrco’s developments.\n\nThe frequent updates and strong support from Optimizely provide Torrco’s team\nwith a clear roadmap to formulate their digital strategies and the assurance\nthat they are on the right track to digital success, improving the business’\ndata-backed decision-making.\n\n## **The pursuit of customer-centric experiences**\n\nWith a solid B2B digital experience in place, Torrco is looking to get a large\nproportion of its total customer base to interact with the website, whether for\nresearch, purchase or as a source to solve their problems.\n\nTorrco also plans to improve their catalog for their site to act as a resource\nfor relevant stakeholders, both internal and external. The ideal outcome would\nbe to shift the search for products from informational to transactional and\nultimately, improve checkout conversion rates.\n\nPersonalization is also high on their list of priorities so that they can\nconstantly improve product and content recommendations. They want to deliver\nrecommendations promptly through customer behavior insights.\n\nFinally, Torrco envisions a stronger omnichannel presence to empower customers\nto interact and transact in their preferred manner while ensuring the same\nexceptional customer experience.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.torrco.com/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nXNGAGE\n\nXNGAGE is a Digital Services firm focused on delivering Commerce Success in B2B\nfor leading manufacturers, distributors, and wholesalers.",

    "content": "# American Academy of Neurology sees 20% increase in mobile traffic\n\n## A collaboration of health professionals\n\nThe American Academy of Neurology (AAN) is the world’s largest association of\nneurologists and neuroscience professionals, with 36,000 members. Founded in\n1948 and based in Minneapolis, MN, the AAN strives to promotes the highest\nquality patient-centered neurologic care and enhance member career satisfaction.\n\nA central objective of the AAN’s digital infrastructure is to provide their\ngrowing membership base true ease-of-use. Given the crucial role in their\nprofessional lives, many AAN members have tight time constraints. Fast\n‘findability’ of assets is critical to a successful user journey.\n\n“Our members are top-of-the-line in their field, and they expect highly of us as\nan association that serves them.’’\n\nCarly Ferry, Senior Manager, Digital Content, American Academy of Neurology\n\n## An updated platform that doesn’t eat time\n\nThe AAN’s existing digital environment, while fit for purpose, was in need of a\nrevamp. The Ektron solution provided a solid, practical workflow where teams\nwere able to collaborate; however, it no longer served members to a level they\nwere expecting. The association wanted to change the look and feel of the\nwebsite and begin working on a personalization suite in order to create dynamic\ncontent for its members.\n\nThe AAN undertook a thorough market discovery exercise. After their research of\nmultiple vendors, they appointed Optimizely as their new digital platform\nprovider.\n\nThe objective was to refocus and redesign the AAN’s website to provide the best\nlevel of service for members.\n\n## Delivering experiences with ease\n\nAccording to AAN Senior Manager, Digital Content, Carly Ferry, it wasn’t\ndifficult convincing the wider team to move to Optimizely. The AAN saw in\nOptimizely a content management solution that would help the team manage and\nindividualize content experiences in one screen. The solution offered\npersonalization functionality so teams could personalize content according to\npersonas, segments, or individual users. Visitor groups were a welcome venture\nfor the AAN as they were able to dissect personas and differentiate content\nbased on their career stage.\n\n## Actively changing expectations\n\n‘’It was a huge leap. We have never done personalized features before. It’s a\nbig component for our new website.‘’ Carly Ferry, Senior Manager, Digital\nContent, American Academy of Neurology\n\n## Transformation in action\n\nIn just three months the AAN transitioned its designs into Optimizely and\nmigrated all its content ready for membership use. The association used the\nvisitor group feature of Optimizely to help create weekly content on the site’s\nhomepage. The new site is turnkey, usable on all devices, simple, and clear.\n\n“For us, the website needs to be able to provide the best level of service to\nour members and help them find whatever tools they're looking for as simply as\npossible.'' Carly Ferry, Senior Manager, Digital Content, American Academy of\nNeurology.\n\nThe AAN set the benchmark internally to make sure it had been successful. Part\nof that was usability of service which was tested prior to and after the site\ntransition. It received a lot of feedback from members. Most of this feedback\nwas positive; if any was constructive, the AAN were able to take that feedback\nand make those changes.\n\nThe biggest indicator of success was the number of people who actually logged on\nto the website. Optimizely is engineered to handle high volumes of simultaneous\nlogins. To be able to personalize content to its members, the association needed\nthem to log in. If they were logged out, there was no way of telling who they\nwere. The AAN set a goal to get 60% of its US neurologists to log in and ended\nup getting 80% of its US neurologists logged into the site in one year.\n\nIts website traffic went up since the redesign, and now that the website is\nfully mobile responsive the association has also seen a 20% increase in mobile\ntraffic.\n\nOptimizely has spurred the AAN’s innovation. By using A/B testing from\nOptimizely and testing further personalization techniques, the AAN continues\ntheir digital maturity—well ahead of their industry counterparts.\n\nOpting for Optimizely has heightened the standard for other AAN vendors in other\nareas of their work. The expectation is that they, too, will have excellent\ncustomer service, innovative features, and a trusted understanding of their\nmembership base.\n\n#### Industry\n\nEducation\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

Through Optimizely's platform, the luxury fashion\n> label has created an immersive shopping experience that puts content at its\n> core._**About Dorothee Schumacher**\n\nFounded in 1989 by Düsseldorf native Dorothee Schumacher, the brand began with a\nT-shirt collection before expanding into knitwear. Following the opening of her\nfirst showroom in Düsseldorf in 1994, the brand expanded to Paris and Milan.\nToday, the label offers ready-to-wear fashion and accessories through eight\nflagship stores and various pop-up locations across Europe and the USA, with\ndistribution in 49 countries.\n\nIn 2014, the brand was renamed from SCHUMACHER to DOROTHEE SCHUMACHER, and in\n2017, her son Maximilian Singhoff joined as co-CEO. The company strengthened its\nUS presence with a dedicated showroom in 2020 and now employs 200 people from\nover 16 nations.\n\n## **The online store experience**\n\n_Image: Dorothee Schumacher online store preview (mobile version)_\n\nThe online store serves as both a primary customer touchpoint for B2C and B2B\ncustomers and a central branding platform. I**t is not only a digital sales\nchannel, but also serves as a central platform for the company's brand and\nonline image.** This dual role highlights the importance of seamlessly\nintegrating content and commerce to create a cohesive shopping experience that\ngoes beyond traditional e-commerce.\n\nFor Dorothee Schumacher, this integration between content and commerce\nrepresents a key competitive advantage**, where user experience (UX), design,\nand brand identity work together to create an immersive shopping journey.**\n\n## **The challenge**\n\nIn today's omnichannel retail environment, businesses need a modern website that\ncombines cutting-edge technology with timeless, customizable design features.\nHowever, Dorothee Schumacher's previous e-commerce platform, built on Shopware\n5, was falling short in several critical areas:\n\n1. **Security and Technical Constraints** : The outdated Shopware 5 platform was nearing end-of-support, creating security vulnerabilities and technical limitations.\n2. **Administrative Complexity** : The platform's custom headless frontend architecture, combined with serving both B2B and B2C customers, made system updates extremely challenging.\n3. **Rigid Infrastructure** : The platform's inflexible architecture made it difficult to integrate content management with e-commerce functionality.\n\nAfter extensive evaluation of various solutions, Optimizely emerged as the clear\nchoice, offering an integrated and scalable platform. DEPT, an Optimizely\nEnterprise Solution Partner, supported the relaunch project, building on their\n14 year relationship with Dorothee Schumacher.\n\n## **Why Optimizely stood out**\n\n- Optimizely One's comprehensive platform met all of Dorothee Schumacher's requirements for **seamlessly integrated content management and e-commerce capabilities.**\n- Optimizely's **dedicated support team** , along with their thorough workshops and product demonstrations, played a key role in the selection process.\n- The platform's **intuitive user interface** , particularly the redesigned email editor, made it **exceptionally user-friendly.**\n- The inclusion of Optimizely Campaign provided a **robust, all-in-one email marketing solution.**\n\n_Illustration: Newsletter creation in the new email editor in Campaign_\n_Illustration: The finalized newsletter_\n\n**Relaunch Objectives\\*\\***1.

His team uses Optimizely to drive\nengagement with the site’s video content, measured in clicks and overall video\nviews.\n\nDouglas recently decided to run an experiment he dubbed the “Ken Burns Test.”\nKen Burns is documentary filmmaker who often focuses on subject matter that pre-\ndates film. To make his films more engaging, he utilizes a style in which the\ncamera pans across photos and still images, creating a sense of motion and\nbringing them to life.\n\n_This is an example of Discovery’s original video content pages._\n\nDouglas and his team tested a similar panning effect against their original\nvideo stills, running the experiment on approximately 20,000 visitors to\nDiscovery’s website.\n\nThe “Ken Burns Effect” resulted in a 6% increase in click-throughs into the\nvideo content. Douglas and his team have since applied this learning to videos\nacross the site to further overall engagement and produce a meaningful impact on\nDiscovery Communication's business.\n\n1 col | FullWidth | Container\nQuote Block: Customer Story - Discovery - Quote\n\n### Improving AD viewability\n\nDiscovery also uses optimization to drive another key business objective—ad\nviewability. Using Optimizely’s Moat integration, the team is able to see the\ndirect impact of each Optimizely experiment on their ad metrics, including\nviewability and attention metrics for display, video, mobile, and content ads.\n\nAccording to the Discovery team, the integration has had a tremendous impact in\nimproving ad viewability across their digital properties—including their video\npage, games page, photo galleries, and more. They’re constantly testing the\nsize, placement, and display of ads on each their most valuable pages and\nmeasuring the real-time performance of each variation.\n\n### Looking forward: Page load performance\n\nDiscovery Communications plans to continue to use Optimizely to drive toward its\nkey business objectives and differentiate itself by providing the most engaging,\nrelevant user experiences possible.\n\nNext on the roadmap, the Discovery team will focus on page load performance and\nits impact on engagement, especially on mobile devices.

Before adopting CMP, the company managed marketing efforts through fragmented communication channels which led to inefficiencies and siloed workflows. The CMP provided a unified platform that enabled AJ Produkter to organize and orchestrate all marketing tasks in one place, ensuring consistency and coordination across all regions.\n- Enhanced Workflow Efficiency: The CMP facilitated the creation of a structured task backlog, allowing teams to easily track and follow marketing workflows. This structured approach helped different teams within the organization to collaborate more effectively, breaking down silos and promoting cross-functional teamwork. By simplifying the process and updating the platform three times, AJ Produkter ensured that their marketing operations remained efficient and agile\n- Improved Content Management: Optimizely's CMP allowed AJ Produkter to tag, organize, and visualize marketing campaigns with fields and labels, making it easy to find and manage content. This capability enabled the creation of comprehensive marketing and activity plans that could be visualized across different levels of the organization. The centralized system replaced the use of disparate tools like Excel, Sheets, and PowerPoints, consolidating all information into one accessible platform. The CMP also improved communication and collaboration among teams, leading to higher quality content production and a more enjoyable work environment for team members.\n- Future Integration and Experimentation: AJ Produkter plans to further develop the CMP by integrating it with their CMS for smoother content publishing and exploring connections to other marketing channels, including YouTube and social media. The CMP will also be a crucial tool for AJ Produkter's future experimentation plans, helping them to plan and execute experiments more effectively. By continuing to enhance the platform, AJ Produkter aims to maintain high levels of efficiency and innovation in their marketing efforts, supporting their growth and adaptation in the competitive market.\n\n#### Industry\n\nConsumer goods\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Marketing Platform\n\n### Demo video: master marketing planning with Optimizely\n\nContent planner, calendars, approval workflows and distribution across channels,\neffortless using our unified tool.",

    "content": "# How Move, Inc. reaches revenue optimization goals\n\n## Meet an in-house optimization team staffed for aggressive optimization\n\nMove, Inc. (operator of Realtor.com), a News Corp company, is a provider of\nonline real estate services for consumers and real estate professionals to help\nnavigate all stages of the home-buying process. The company is heavily invested\nin understanding its target audience, with teams devoted to both analytics and\nuser research.\n\nThe company takes action on these insights and measures the impact of changes\nvia a robust optimization program. Suma Warrier leads digital optimization for\nMove, Inc., and has spent her time at the company building out a robust team and\nprocess to enable high-velocity testing.\n\nAt the end of 2013 after Suma joined the company, the revenue goal was set and\ncommunicated across the company. 2014 would become a year where A/B testing and\noptimization contributed to a portion of the company’s revenue. The goal was a\nstretch, which drove strong focus and prioritization. They chose a new\noptimization platform (Optimizely), and began to staff a new team focused on\noptimization.\n\nAt Move, the Optimization team is housed within the Analytics department. For\nthe team to be successful, they needed cross-functional support from Research,\nDesign, Product, QA and Engineering. The core Optimization team included Suma,\nRoger, and Hima to manage the test prioritization, building and running tests,\nand post-experiment analysis. Two key technical assets that they focused on\nassigning immediately were QA and developer resources.\n\n## Scaling an optimization program\n\nAs the optimization team became comfortable with their communication and\nprocess, speed and cadence became a priority. In order to take advantage of the\nbenefits of optimization, Suma wanted to ensure that the team could rapidly test\nmany ideas, quickly make decisions, and incorporate customer data into their\nprocess. By laying a strong foundation, the team was able to reach a pace of\nlaunching 1 new experiment every 2 weeks.\n\nSuma credits the Move team’s success with rapid testing to two factors. First,\nthe optimization tool (Optimizely.) A key criteria in choosing the team’s tool\nwas finding one that would enable rapid testing and empower the end-users. This\nwould become very important to ensuring the team would meet their optimization\ngoals, but also showcased the value of switching to a new tool.\n\nThe second factor was the team’s focus, which allowed them to ask more questions\nabout their customer behavior and find answers faster, while moving the product\nas a whole in the right direction. As Suma puts it, the risk of not moving\nquickly is that ideas will be deliberated, but never executed. Their team took\nthe opposite approach, and was able to reach very tangible, quantifiable goals\nfor their business.\n\n## Analytics-informed experiment: right rail content\n\nIn this experiment, Suma and her team built an experiment hypothesis with\nintelligence collected from their web analytics.\n\nOn the search results page, conversions on right-rail content were relatively\nlow. The Move team wanted to find a way to engage visitors who might not be\nready to click on listings, but are looking for other information that will help\nthem progress towards choosing a home. They hypothesized that surfacing links to\nintermediate steps in the home-buying process would improve search engagement\nwith the right-rail and make conversions in later stages of the conversion\nfunnel more seamless.\n\nSuma and her team added a module (outlined in red) that highlighted getting pre-\nqualified and checking a credit score as logical next steps for visitors.\n\nThe Result: The change in right-rail content didn’t improve conversions, but it\ndid provide an opportunity for further testing. The team was able to move on\nfrom the type of content surfaced to exploring other elements of the right rail\nfunctionality, and how it could improve the visitor experience.\n\nMany teams come to us with ideas that either are something they’re stuck on, or\na small change they want to make. We take a step back and look at the big\npicture, help them to unpack the problem and design a meaningful experiment.\n\nSuma Warrier\n\nSenior Optimization Manager, Move, Inc., Move Inc\n\n## User research-informed experiment: navigation styling\n\nIn usability studies, Move researchers found that when viewing listing pages for\nhome, it was generally simple to complete an action on the page (saving,\nrequesting details, etc.). When it came time to navigate away from the page,\nvisitors were getting stuck. They wanted to see other houses and view other\nresults from their searches.\n\nThe optimization team hypothesized that adding a “Back to search” link would\nhelp users understand where to navigate once they were ready to leave a listing\npage.\n\nA “Back to search” link was added to the navigation elements, next to a\nbreadcrumb. This experiment focused on helping visitors to engage with multiple\nlistings during their sessions, increasing the likelihood that they would\nadvance further down the conversion funnel.\n\n_The Result: The change positively affected the engagement of visitors on\nlisting and search pages, demonstrating that the researched change made a\nquantifiable impact on the visitor experience._\n\n### Optimization success and the future for Move, Inc.\n\nBy maintaining close alignment and open communication with their analytics and\nuser research peers, the Move, Inc. team is able to consistently produce high-\nquality experiments that help each group to accomplish and measure their goals\nwhile improving the usability of their site and overall customer experience.\n\nAs Move’s optimization program has become more visible and successful, many\nother teams have started to brainstorm areas where they wanted to test and\noptimize. Suma hopes that in 2015, the team will successfully scale best\npractices for ideating, prioritizing, and executing experiments.\n\nIn the meantime, S",

    "content": "# Nobia\n\nEurope’s leading kitchen specialist, Nobia, dish digital transformation across\ntheir portfolio of brands with Optimizely\n\n## A disjointed network\n\nNobia was faced with the challenge of having separate websites for its brands,\neach developed in-house together with different suppliers and across different\nplatforms. The features differed from site to site, and hosting was managed by a\nmix of external suppliers.\n\nNobia wanted to create a future external web platform on Optimizely and find a\nlong-term strategic partner to develop and support it. Following a rigorous\nprocurement process, NetRelations was chosen as partner, and an exciting journey\ntowards a new web platform began in the spring of 2013.\n\n## Realising Digital Ambitions\n\nThe technical web platform that emerged under the name Hercules is built on\nOptimizely CMS in combination with peripheral products, services, and\nintegrations. This was valued as the best technical solution again Nobia’s\nambitions.\n\nThe overall functionality includes:\n\n- Extremely flexible template system using blocks to create dynamic solutions within and between websites\n- Booking management for meetings, with links to ERP, CRM, and email systems\n- Image gallery based on ImageVault 4 and Optimizely Find\n- Optimizely Commerce Catalog for orders\n- Collaboration workspace between customers and kitchen stores, with unique customer accounts to enable remote planning of their kitchen purchases\n- Capability to integrate external CRM systems for tracking prospect activity\n\nWhen building the Hercules platform, Optimizely Premium Partner NetRelations,\nfocused on maximizing the potential of the blocks method, which offers enormous\nflexibility for controlling both appearance and logic within and between the\nvarious brands’ own websites.\n\nThe entire solution demanded the utmost in providing a modern, flexible and\naccessible user experience that would work seamlessly between different devices.\nA huge effort in responsive-design has created one of the market’s most\neffective mobile interfaces.\n\nThe solution also needed to consider a global market comprised of different\nunits, languages and behavioral trends.\n\nThe entire Group’s digital marketing and web platforms now converge in a single\nOptimizely enterprise solution, whose configuration and version management are\nthe only elements that differ when delivering the websites for Poggenpohl, HTH\nor another one of Nobia’s brands.\n\nThe spring of 2013 saw the launch of the first website, poggenpohl.com, on the\nHercules platform as a proof-of-concept site. In 2014, the first full-scale\nwebsite was launched based on Hercules, followed by the successful launch of all\nbrand websites throughout 2014-2015. E-commerce functionality was also launched\nin 2015.\n\n### Simplifying the buying process through digital\n\nFrom dreams of a new kitchen to a long-lasting relationship. Committing to\nbuying a kitchen requires a large purchasing decision from the customer. The\nmain purpose of building the digital was to simplify the customer journey.\n\nTo reflect this purpose, each individual brand site was developed to simplify\nand enhance the customer experience for visitors who had bought or were\nconsidering buying a kitchen.\n\nNobia wanted to mark a clear transition from the static catalog to a powerful\nlead generation tool. The goal of the new digital solution was to create a\ncentral point of control for content production.\n\nThe web solution, therefore, uses a service design perspective as its starting\npoint, where each individual feature, content item or service supports one or\nmore elements of the customer journey.\n\n### Inspirational content = customer engagement\n\nThe goal is to inspire and engage potential customers, drive relevant traffic to\nthe physical stores (from an omnichannel perspective) and simply make it easier\nto buy a kitchen. So, from the outset, Nobia focused on creating inspirational\ncontent, simplifying customer dialogue and creating a higher integration and\nvalue add between the digital and the physical customer interaction.\n\n### Brand engagement\n\nEngagement begins in a connection outside of a brand’s website with a strong\nfocus on presence and interaction, one that creates digital visibility in\nchannels like social media. There are two ways to Nobia engage with social\nmedia; by sharing content from the current website and by getting inspiration\nfrom external channels and storing it on the site’s digital collaboration\nworkspace.\n\n### KPIs simplify prioritization and development\n\nWhen developing the functionality, content, and services for each site and for\nthe platform, NetRelations and Nobia kept a sharp focus on measurement and\nanalysis from day one, using tools like Google Universal Analytics and Tag\nManager.\n\nRight from the outset, measurement methods and zero values were established.\nSince the launch, KPIs have been continuously evaluated and then used to support\ndevelopment priorities as well as enhancements to established functionality.\n\nIn addition to the detailed report, the major KPIs are aggregated in a\ndashboard. This dashboard overview enables the various stakeholders to compare\nthemselves with each other and learn from each other.\n\nThe dashboard, also built on Optimizely, is built on a separate domain in order\nto make it available to everyone. By using Optimizely integrations for the\nplatform, Google Analytics, and Facebook, data is retrieved and then visualized\nin charts with clear indicators.\n\nThis information, both within and between the different brands, is also\navailable to support marketers so that they can draw conclusions about trends\nand behavior across and between markets.\n\nQualitative user studies are provided on an ongoing basis by other external\npartners to Nobia, who conduct in-depth interviews and user analyses.\n\n### A business-driven solution that achieves established targets\n\nToday, conclusions and business benefits have been documented to support ROI as\nwell as the goal of more satisfied customers and increased sales.\n\n- Organic traffic has increased by approximately 30%.\n- 15-20% of visitors visit the image gallery. These visitors tend to continue to store more than other visitors do.\n- The most valuable conversion on the sites",

These visitors tend to continue to store more than other visitors do.\n- The most valuable conversion on the sites takes place when a visitor books an appointment with a kitchen designer. Since the launch, the total number of appointments increased by 20% thanks to simplified workflows and a more targeted digital marketing effort to achieve this target. In addition to direct appointments, the sites deliver beyond expectations when it comes to getting a bigger share of the visitors to search for and find information about the stores.\n\nBesides the business benefits mentioned above, strong synergies and better\nquality and continuity are achieved by creating and operating a common platform\nwhere all Nobia brands can share the development and administrative costs\nassociated with their digital marketing efforts and the web. Quality assurance\nis simplified, too, when headquarters can serve as a center of excellence.\n\n### Actual specific customer value created is a simpler, faster and easier\n\ninteraction between the customer and the brand.\n\nWith the power of Optimizely's Content Cloud, visitors can choose to engage by\ncreating their own account where they can gather inspirational ideas. Whenever\nthey want to, the visitors can then share all the information with a selected\nkitchen store to speed up and simplify the buying process. It’s precisely this\nability to collaborate with the customer through digital collaboration\nworkspaces that have sped up the buying process and has created a much greater\nunderstanding of customer motivation and behavior.\n\nThis combination results in greater customer engagement even before the in-\nperson interaction as well as opportunities for more proactive lead nurturing\nthroughout the process.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

    "content": "# A new website focused on lead generation for Piab\n\nPiab is boldly claiming a position in the digital landscape with a brand\nexpression that stands out among other industrial companies.\n\nAfter completing extensive branding work, developing a completely new website\nwas the logical next step for automation company Piab. The existing website was\nhampered by a growing complexity that impaired the user experience and failed to\nconvey the new Piab brand identity.\n\nPiab needed a website capable of supporting its growth journey and presenting\nits products and services in the best possible way. To make the website\nattractive to all target groups—from existing customers to new visitors and job\nseekers—it needed to be well-structured, easy to navigate and data-driven. It\nshould contain “calls to action” and enable conversions, as well as integration\nwith social media.\n\nIn collaboration with Optimizely’s partner Consid, Piab launched a comprehensive\nproject to build its new digital presence. One stipulation from Piab was that\nthe new website should offer lead-generating opportunities. This is supported by\nchat functionality, login, download options, contact forms and other “calls to\naction”.\n\n## **The solution**\n\nOptimizely’s content platform is the hub of the new website, along with InRiver\nfor managing product information. The search function is based on Elastic\nFramework. The website is also integrated with the Piab Marketing Automation\nplatform (Pardot) for seamless transfer of all leads and contacts generated on\nthe website. There are also additional integrations with underlying systems,\nincluding business systems and ecommerce.\n\nThe information pages were redesigned with a completely new interface, and the\ncontent assets have been repackaged in a new concept on the new website. In the\nfirst phase, the ecommerce functionality remained on the old website, while the\nentire product range with their associated information was presented on both the\nold and the new website.\n\nThe Piab brand was front and center in the development project. New\nfunctionality was added to UX templates, with the Piab brand identity\nunderpinning the design. The new website stands out in the industry, and the\ngoals for improved experience and user-friendliness have been met.\n\nThe central functions of the website are built around the Piab portfolio, with\ndifferent types of products and configurable services. Examples of new\nfunctionality that makes things easier for the user include CAD center, “Help me\nchoose”, and an interactive map where visitors can easily search among the Piab\noffices and merchandisers.\n\n## **The result**\n\nThe new Piab website was first launched as a public beta, which is usually\nrecommended in projects with large, complex websites with a lot of logic and\ndependencies. This made it possible to get more of the Piab stakeholders\nonboard—customers, partners and employees.\n\nAs a second step, Piab is planning to remodel its merchandiser portal My Piab,\nin line with the new-look website. Ecommerce will also be transferred to the\nsame environment as the new website.\n\nWe have a hypermodern website built on Optimizely and InRiver. We’re now well\nprepared and adaptable ahead of Piab’s future growth.\n\nAnette Lantz\n\nDigital Experience Manager, Piab\n\n## **About Piab**\n\nPiab is a Swedish company that has been evolving automation through progressive\ngripping, lifting and moving solutions since 1951.

    "content": "# Young Specialties drives online adoption with B2B Commerce Cloud\n\n## Transforming to digital to support evolving needs of buyers\n\nYoung Specialties was founded in 1986 by a hygienist who saw the challenges that\nher orthodontic patients had maintaining good hygiene. She could not find a\nfitting solution for her patients, so she created one. Thirty years later, her\ndesign remains one of the market-leading dual-head toothbrushes.\n\nYoung Specialties has expanded their offering to include orthodontic supplies,\npractice-branded personalized toothbrushes and thousands of other products that\nhelp orthodontists, pediatric dentists and general practitioners improve the\npatient experience, bolster their marketing efforts and support at-home care for\npatients.\n\nLike other B2B industries, there is consolidation and acquisition happening\nwithin Young Specialties’s customer base. There are somewhere around 130,000\ndental offices, but large organizations are starting to acquire them.\nProfessional buyers from large organizations generally don’t want to deal with\nrep phone calls and would prefer web-based solutions.\n\nRecognizing the changing nature of the industry and the evolving needs of their\nbuyers, Young Specialties ventured on a journey of digital transformation. They\nneeded to give practitioners simpler ways to buy online. The journey started\nwith a legacy eCommerce system that Young Specialties eventually outgrew.\n\nWe now have a scalable eCommerce solution that will allow us to grow and expand\nin the future whether that be via the creation of new eCommerce storefronts or\nsimply the addition of new products to our existing website\n\nScott Leece\n\nVP Business Process Optimization, Plak Smacker\n\n## From turnkey to best-in-class\n\nYoung Specialties’s initial eCommerce system was not easy to manage, which held\nthem back from making changes to better serve their customers. They were not\nable to manage it internally. Every change required relying an external\nconsultant, which was not ideal for their growing business.\n\nMaking matters more difficult, the original platform wasn’t integrated with\nYoung Specialties’s ERP. Siloed systems meant misaligned pricing and time\nconsuming, manual order entry.\n\nOne of Young Specialties’s most popular categories of products is their\ncustomizable branded toothbrushes. Selling this product required numerous\ntouchpoints from employees in sales, customer service and operations in order to\ncomplete orders, which was a less than ideal situation.\n\nAfter identifying pain points across their legacy eCommerce system, Young\nSpecialties was ready to make an investment in a more sophisticated solution. As\na supplier of numerous B2B products, they needed a solution that understood\ntheir complex business and seamlessly integrated with their ERP.\n\nOptimizely B2B Commerce Cloud provided Young Specialties the ability to:\n\n- Integrate with their ERP\n- Eliminate manual order entry\n- Eliminate product, inventory and price mismatch between the ERP and eCommerce\n- Leverage an online product configurator, creating a user-friendly product customization experience\n- Automate the personalization process\n- Easily and cost-effectively manage the eCommerce system from the Admin Console\n\n## Driving adoption and scaling for growth\n\nAfter launching Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, Young Specialties’s team and\nbuyers were better enabled to do their jobs. Today, the team can easily make\nchanges to the platform and buyers are satisfied with online purchasing options.\nYoung Specialties’s goal is to double their revenue online. Young Specialties is\nworking to make the website more integrated into their sales and lead generation\nprocess.\n\nSince Young Specialties drives growth via acquisition, the eCommerce solution\nhad to be flexible enough to accommodate growth. With Optimizely B2B Commerce\nCloud, Young Specialties is positioned for the future.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.plaksmacker.com/",

Dating back to 1899, the business produces and markets its own\nproducts as well as commercialising other licensed brands such as Van Gogh,\nRembrandt and Bruynzeel. Steeped in history, they are one of the most\nrecognisable fine arts brands in the world.\n\nRoyal Talens wanted to develop a new digital experience for the business and a\ncustomer portal that better reflects the nature of the organization. Royal\nTalens most known for its iconic brands such as Rembrandt and Van Gogh and the\nproduct ranges it offers. The new digital offering needed to focus not only on\nthe iconic brands, but also Royal Talens as a business in its own right. The\ndigital experience platform needed to be a valuable resource for all of its\ncustomers from professional artists, to creative hobbyists, and even school\nchildren.\n\nRoyal Talens required a best-in-class content management platform to deliver\nbespoke content from the technical advisors at Royal Talens, pulled from their\nown experiences or current trends in the art world. Royal Talens wanted this\ncontent to spark creativity and empower its visitors because it is insightful\nand an educational read.\n\nOptimizely Content Cloud solution was chosen for the project. Its core CMS\nfeatures and functionality as well as advanced tools for personalization,\nrecommendations and analytics helped to create a website and customer portal\nthat better reflects both its retailers and customers. The elastic scalability\ninclusive to the platform enables Royal Talens' brand to grow seamlessly with\ntheir international growth.\n\nThe platform also has all the digital tools Royal Talens need, at their\ndisposal. They adapt content depending on the type of visitor. For example, if a\nvisitor starts looking at oil paint, they will need plenty more information and\ndata on the products offered. The higher the quality, the higher the difficulty\nand so the more explanation needed. Royal Talens acknowledge this by deploying\neasy-to-follow, step-by-step plans for hobbyists and semi-professional artists.\n\nWe think that e-commerce is sales driven and to have everybody on board, it must\nbe more service-driven. So we can get all salespeople involved in the rollout of\nthe portal in the sales team and also on the website.\n\nVictor Streppel\n\nManager, Digital Services, Royal Talens\n\nOptimizely helped Royal Talens achieve a versatile customer portal that better\nreflects its business.

The internal team\nhave been empowered to create engaging content, within a controlled and\ncentralised environment that’s very much on brand and speaks to a wide range of\nconsumers that use Royal Talens portfolio of products. The team have also\nincreased productivity internally by using the tools within workflow to help\nmanage content projects.\n\nGiven their growing distribution network, Royal Talens have decided not to\n''Bypass the retailer''.They have taken a conscious decision that they will not\nsell to end consumers.\n\nFurther personalization of content is the next major priority on Royal Talens’\ntechnology road map. It hopes to improve how it speaks directly to individuals\nwithin the creative space with tailored content and would like to have an even\nbetter and deeper relationship and understanding of its customers’ requirements.\nThe next step is to create a highly responsive site with the ability to change\ncontent depending on the user group.

The US-based business is experiencing an\nenormous growth period, with an annual processing volume of over $133bn across\nnine million transactions daily on the one million payment devices it has\nshipped all over the world.\n\nThe Digital Growth team at Clover is responsible for optimizing its customers’\ndigital experience. The business relies on experimentation to guide digital\ndecision-making which enables Clover and its customers to quickly learn and\nmeasure what changes deliver the best outcomes for the users.

Its portfolio of brands includes well-loved parks\nsuch as SeaWorld®, Busch Gardens®, Aquatica®, and Sesame Place®.\n\nAs its customers have increasingly turned to digital channels to purchase\ntickets and add-on experiences, SeaWorld, as part of a larger digital\ntransformation initiative, took on the challenge of modernizing their 12 branded\nwebsites, with a relentless focus on improving usability and increasing\nconversion.\n\n## **Identifying opportunities through a comprehensive data framework**\n\nHistorical website data was sparse, so the newly organized Digital team\nestablished a baseline of tools, methods, and KPIs to guide the optimization\neffort:\n\n- Granular conversion funnel reporting to identify significant drop-off points\n- Customer feedback study to understand top detractors and promoters\n- Page-level interaction analysis and heatmaps to recognize on-page frustrations and engagement\n\n- Live usability studies and session replays to gather qualitative insights and identify root causes\n- Transaction data analysis to determine impactful segments to focus on\n- A/B testing to validate hypotheses independent of other business changes\n\nOver 100 hours of research and analysis led to several actionable insights:\n\n- Over 75% of site traffic was on a mobile device, and because the sites were not designed or optimized for mobile, user frustration was much higher there than on desktop. To have the greatest impact, they’d need to take a mobile-first approach.\n- User research showed that customers lacked clarity at key moments in the purchase flow. Questions like _“Do younger children get in free?”_ and _“What if I need to reschedule or cancel a planned visit?''_ , without an easy way to find an answer, led to uncertainty, support calls, and lost revenue. It was important to learn what customers need to know, and when, and then placing that information where it mattered most.\n- Session replays illuminated user behaviors and expectations throughout their journeys. It became clear that users wanted to click on images to get to more details, poor form design caused friction between the cart and checkout, and checkout errors became blockers due to unclear error messaging.\n\n## \\*\\*Relentless pursuit for optimized experiences through rapid\n\nexperimentation\\*\\*\n\nSeaWorld identified Optimizely as a powerful experimentation partner due to the\nsimplicity of using a visual editor, robust post-experiment analytics, and\nability to scale support for multiple websites and platforms including native\nmobile apps. To aid in SeaWorld’s success, Optimizely’s Experimentation Services\nteam leaned in to validate some of the early metrics, allowing SeaWorld to\ndouble down on a solid foundation to scale rapidly. SeaWorld also integrated\nOptimizely with Quantum Metric to sync real-time customer behavior with their\nexisting testing strategy which proved critical to provide direction and\ncontext. This integration allowed the group to focus experimentation on top\ncustomer needs, improved the testing success rate, and ultimately validated the\nimpact of optimization on the customer experience.\n\nThe SeaWorld team wanted to maximize the ROI on early experiments, so their\nexperimentation journey started at the bottom of the funnel, where conversions\noccur. Risks were mitigated by testing hypotheses on their lower traffic sites,\nand porting validated solutions to higher traffic sites.\n\nOver the course of a few months, Optimizely’s high-velocity testing capabilities\nenabled SeaWorld to run over 50 experiments from homepage to checkout.\nSuccessful experiments informed SeaWorld about what worked best for their\ncustomers. As is often seen with experimentation, some findings were contrary to\nprior beliefs, reinforcing the need for frequent and consistent A/B testing.\n\nSeaWorld’s team was new to the company, but they brought meaningful previous\ne-commerce experience and relied on best practices during experimentation:\n\n- Every brand and park website had different customers, products, and associated behaviors. As a result, the team adapted to new findings for each website without assuming winning experiments were perfectly transferable to other sites.\n- With the goal to drive impact quickly, the team started with compound changes on a single page. If there was an additional need to understand the impact of individual changes, they would be decoupled and validated separately via multi-variant testing.\n- Because the business runs various sales/promotions at different times of the year, winning experiments were re-tested multiple times to ensure results were consistent during promotional events.\n- Optimizely data was tied to other sources of input including customer feedback, session replays, transactional product mix – this led to holistic data-driven decision making that went deeper into why some experiments worked while others did not.\n- In some cases where trade-offs were required, in-session experimentation data was supplemented with offline/lifetime value data to understand the downstream impact of a change and determine if it was net-positive for the company.\n\nAn example of a cart optimization experiment that drove impact:\n\n**_Analysis and research_**\n\n- Funnel data showed cart-to-checkout progression rate was lower than benchmarks, especially on mobile devices",

Additionally, there were several unintentional clicks: eg, on the header, on the CTA to go to checkout before the login form was filled.\n- Transactional data showed only some users were purchasing products that required sign in; signed-in users converted lower vs. guest checkouts.\n\n**_Hypotheses_**\n\n- Separating the cart flow into two distinct steps (view cart, login), and redesigning the form will reduce cognitive overload and correct user errors\n- Simplifying the order summary and swapping its placement with the list of items will allow users to manipulate cart items but also see cross-sells\n- Defaulting to guest checkout will reduce the friction for majority of users\n- Displaying a guest-friendly cancellation policy will increase confidence\n- Increasing the size of buttons and adopting a modern design system will bring the experience closer to other websites that users are familiar with\n\n**_Results_** (vary based on website)\n\n- 5-10% increase in cross-sells added to cart\n- 3-4% increase in visits from cart to checkout\n- 1% lift in conversion\n\n| **Before (Control)** | **After (Test)** |\n| -------------------- | ---------------- |\n\n|\n\n## **Testing & learning pay off for SeaWorld**\n\nSeaWorld Parks & Entertainment Inc. had record business performance in 2021\nbecause of several revenue initiatives, including the digital transformation\nwork. During this time, SeaWorld’s websites saw tangible conversion lifts by\nimproving the pre-visit customer journey, while its mobile apps achieved\nindustry-leading app store ratings after a full, in-park customer journey\nfocused rebuild.\n\nKey objectives for website optimization were to create modern pre-visit\nexperiences, significantly reduce page load times, and allow seamless recovery\nfrom any errors. To this end:\n\n- Learnings from the experimentation phase were supplemented with a modern design system, and conversion funnel pages were rebuilt to reduce friction and confusion. Newly redesigned pages were re-tested using Optimizely to ensure gains are consistent with prior learnings, and the components are being rolled out in batches to the 12 websites over the course of 2021-2022.\n- Bottom of funnel failure rates were cut in half, through thoughtful design and service improvements, eliminating redundant errors, and improving success rates by providing actionable error messages.\n- Latency on key user actions (e.g., add-to-carts) was improved by 40%, and further levers like optimizing payload will significantly improve page load times.\n\nOverall, these improvements have led to millions of dollars of additional\nrevenue, and a significant improvement in website usability scores.\n\n## **Taking it to the next level with Optimizely**\n\nSeaWorld looks to Optimizely not only as an experimentation partner, but as a\nsource of truth, and a platform to guide decision making on a variety of digital\ninitiatives. As SeaWorld continues to unlock new capabilities and further\nimprove the customer experience, it will use Optimizely to facilitate a fail-\nfast, continuous, product development cycle and plan to explore even more\nOptimizely capabilities to achieve faster and deeper levels of experimentation.\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://seaworld.com/",

    "content": "# Fjällräven launches a new ecommerce site in under 4 months\n\n## Bringing digital to the outdoors\n\nFenix Outdoor were on a mission to transform their brands’ ecommerce websites by\nupgrading to a framework that could launch multiple brands operating on the same\ncodebase. They also wanted to manage their products better by implementing a\nProduct Information Management software (PIM) and required a multi-market,\nmulti-currency, and multi-language solution. At the time, they were not using\nany unified framework for their numerous brand websites, causing issues for\ntheir IT teams.\n\nBecause of its extensive capabilities, Fenix Outdoor chose Optimizely as its\ndigital commerce platform, inRiver as a PIM, and selected Luminos Labs for their\nsystems integration expertise and the ability to launch quickly. They chose\nFjallraven as the first website to build a framework on and to scale out to the\nother brands.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe on-site discovery took place in Sweden to strategize Fjallraven’s problems,\nneeds, and goals, and the teams came up with a three-phase approach:\n\n## Phase I – Launch Fjallraven on Optimizely\n\nThe main goal was launching an ecommerce platform as quickly as possible, using\nOptimizely as the digital engine. The Luminosity Optimizely Accelerator allowed\nFjallraven to save 100s of hours of website discovery, design, and development.\nAn open-API architecture was created to support a wide array of potential\nintegration needs (ERP, legacy systems, etc.), scalability, as well as the\nability to launch B2B sites in future phases, on one platform that can support\nboth B2B & B2C.\n\n## Phase II: Prepare for global rollout and implement PIM\n\nAfter the initial website launched, the goal was to prepare the site for\ninternational markets using available Optimizely features to build out these\nfunctionalities. Fjallraven required a solution that would allow them to operate\nin different countries and offer specific products for each market (multi-\nmarket), use different currencies, tax rules, payment providers, shipping\nproviders, and fulfillment centers depending on the country (multi-currency),\nand default to a set language while providing options to translate to another\n(multi-language).\n\n## Phase III: Scale-out to Fenix Outdoor’s other brands\n\nDuring this phase, Fjallraven also decided to integrate the inRiver PIM with\ntheir ERP and ecommerce site. They used the Luminosity inRiver Connector,\navailable in the Optimizely App Marketplace, to sync inRiver product information\nto Optimizely automatically, map data from inRiver, leverage complex product\nattributes through inRiver PIM to automatically sync and organize within\nOptimizely, and manage complex catalogs and multiple taxonomy scenarios. inRiver\ndesigns were required to meet the same specifications as the website to\neventually scale and support multiple sites and products to be available in\ndifferent markets.\n\nFenix will apply the Optimizely framework used for Fjallraven to other brands.\nThis phase involves utilizing the same general codebase and scaling it out to\nother brands to have the same multi-market, multi-language, and multi-currency\nfeatures. The sites will all have the same backend usability features, using the\nsame admin backend tools to support those websites as well.\n\nWith customers across the world, we knew that updating our digital presence with\na platform for the future would secure our growth trajectory in the outdoor\nadventure market. With plans to further integrate our back-end with new ERP, PIM\nand other platforms, Optimizely’s open-API architecture made it an easy decision\nto cement Optimizely as the foundation for future digital success.\n\nNadir Ali\n\nHead of Digital, Fenix Outdoors AG\n\n## Scalable multi-website framework launched in under four months\n\nFjallraven launched its website in under four months due to the usage of the\nLuminosity Optimizely Accelerator. In that short period, they were able to build\nand integrate a new ecommerce site using Optimizely as their backend solution,\nwith the ability to scale.\n\nInitially, Fjallraven had a previous implementation partner that wasn’t able to\nhandle the full scale of their inRiver PIM integration. Luminos Labs was able to\ndeliver the PIM implementation successfully, and used the Luminosity inRiver\nConnector to sync data to the website in a proper manner, integrating with their\nERP system, updating price data and stock data every hour.\n\n- Multi-Market, Multi-Currency, and Multi-Language Capabilities\n- Multi-Market\n- Specifically defined products\n- Shipping providers\n- Tax rules\n- Payment providers\n- Fulfillment centers with functionality built-in for growth\n- United States, Germany, England, France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Netherlands, and other EU countries\n- Multi-Currency\n- Each market has its own currency and can have multiple currency options\n- Up to four different payment integrations available depending on the market (credit card, POS, and online banking)\n- Multi-Language\n\nEach market has its own language and can have multiple language options:English\nUS & UK, Swedish, Finnish, French, German, Danish, Norwegian\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.fjallraven.com/se/sv-se",

The site needed to be modern, easy to use, and\nrobust, offering a means of adhering to national brand guidelines while allowing\nlocal franchises to customize their local information.\n\nFor these reasons, Episerver was chosen to support a modern, inviting, and\nhighly functional budgetblinds.com.\n\n## Drawing out the objectives\n\n- Redeploy both the technology and the brand image for HFC’s flagship brand, Budget Blinds\n- Deliver a modern, easy to use, and robust experience - offering a means of adhering to national brand guidelines while allowing local franchises to customize their local information\n- HFC required a platform that offered ease of use for their marketing teams as well as personalization and potential for commerce opportunities at scale.\n\n## Turning a blind eye to on prem\n\nWith the help of partner, Verndale, HFC transformed its aging Ektron\ninstallation into a modern, inviting, and highly functional budgetblinds.com.\n\nA hallmark of the development is the ability to default national brand content\nfor each localized site – which can now be tailored to meet each franchisee’s\nlocal market. Franchisees have easy access to branded content and can adapt and\nmodify local franchise information as needed. This provides franchisees a near\nturnkey approach to deploying their own sites. Using items like static and smart\nreplacement tokens to load localized content easily, we were able to deliver a\nplatform that dynamically adapts to changes using smart navigation, dynamic\nsitemaps, and robots to integrate with CMS. In addition, we integrated the\nclient’s internal tracking process with customized Episerver forms.\n\nVerndale and HFC worked in a co-development fashion using Optimizely to\nsuccessfully deploy a more modern design and user experience. The updated\nexperience provided flexibility for franchisees to utilize the power of a robust\ncontent management solution.\n\nWith Optimizely, the website will empower both corporate marketing and IT to\nmanage a single robust platform while giving franchisees the opportunity to\npersonalize and sell to their target markets.\n\nNow, HFC has a very solid, scalable platform to accommodate additional\nproperties can be folded into the platform with ease.\n\nBudgetblinds has over 1,000 individual franchises which creates complexities\naround offering a consistent experience but allowing enough room to offer\npersonalized experiences for different expectations across the United States.\nHFC is now primed to make a big impact as they continue to push the envelope on\nthis balance of consistency and personalization.\n\nHome Franchise Concepts has the answer, with Budget Blinds, Tailored Living and\nConcrete Craft.\n\nThe franchise experts of Home Franchise Concepts (HFC) are dedicated to helping\npeople go into business for themselves— and to help them grow their home-based\nfranchise business to be as successful as possible.

That was about four years ago and that's really when we started to partner\nwith Wunderman Thompson, who have been our partner from the start, in order to\nwork with them to deliver and improve customer experiences on the platform.\n\nWe have the best of breed content marketing platform, but we have not\nnecessarily been using it to deliver the best end user experiences and that's\nwhat we've been working on over the past few years.\n\n### What role did your partner Wunderman Thompson play in the implementation of\n\nOptimizely One platform?\n\n**Bjorn Barnard** : So Wunderman Thompson helped us specifically with our\nadoption of the Optimizely One platform. At ACCO Brands Europe, we outsource all\nof our technical development and web development to Wunderman Thompson.\n\nWe rely on them to help us strategize our architecture. They deliver all of our\ntechnical developments; we rely on their QA and UI resources and we really\npartner with them as an extension of ACCO Brands' marketing team to deliver the\ndigital experiences that we wish to deliver to our end users.\n\nThe project process we adopted with Wunderman Thompson that started the project\nis we ran several e-commerce best practice audits, comparing the customer\njourneys that we're running on our websites. And from that we created a body of\nwork and a series of bite-sized projects that we could deliver over an extended\nroadmap.\n\n### Were you looking to integrate Optimizely’s Customized Commerce solution with\n\nany other tech platforms or software? If so, what were they?\n\n**Bjorn Barnard** : We gave our partners, Wunderman Thompson, three main\ntechnologies to integrate with on the Optimizely One platform. We have our own\nbespoke PIM system, which presents challenges. We already use Optimizely\nCampaign for our database and email marketing activities. And then we integrate\nwith our dealers using Prisync by Commerce Connector to send leads to our\nchannel partners.\n\n### What benefits does the Optimizely One platform provide to you and your team\n\nthat were absent previously?\n\n**Bjorn Barnard** : Since we've been using Optimizely One platform to the extent\nthat we are now, we've really seen improvements in content management\nefficiencies. The platform we're using gives us control that we need at a\ncentral level, but the flexibility for our local markets to localize content as\nthey see fit.\n\nWe're doing that much quicker now, 61% quicker in fact, thanks to our leveraging\nof Optimizely's project feature. and guidance by the team at Wunderman Thompson.\n\nSo, we integrate now with MemoQ, which is our translation management software to\nthat we have. In addition to that, we have also seen an increase in where to buy\nleads going off to our channel partners. That's really important for us as we\ndon't sell directly. Our improved UX has",

In addition to that, we have also seen an increase in where to buy\nleads going off to our channel partners. That's really important for us as we\ndon't sell directly. Our improved UX has driven an 80% increase in the first\nfour months of this year with more leads going off to our customers. So that's\nsomething that the team is really proud of, and our customers of course are also\nreally happy.\n\nWe also make use of Optimizely's Visitor Group functionality to deliver\npersonalized landing pages to users coming in from paid activity. That's not\nonly good for us in terms of conversion events, but it's also good for our\nchannel partners because on those landing pages we're able to, based on the\nincoming URL using Optimizely's visitor group functionality, present content\nthat leads customers directly off to specific dealers and at a marketing level\nthat allows us to work with our dealers and invest some of their rebate monies\nand marketing development funds in paid activities that benefit the wider\nbusiness as well. So it's a win-win for everybody.\n\n### What features and solutions are you using from Optimizely One platform and\n\nhow do they help you achieve your goals?\n\n**Bjorn Barnard** : We use a range of features and solutions from Optimizely One\nplatform. We use Optimizely CMS to manage our content across multiple brands and\nlanguages. We use Optimizely Campaign to run our email marketing and product\nrecommendations on the site. We use Optimizely Search and Navigation to improve\nour site search and product discovery. We use Optimizely Visitor Groups to\ncreate personalized landing pages and content based on user behavior and\nattributes. And we use Optimizely Analytics to measure and optimize our\nperformance and conversions.\n\n### How does Optimizely impact or improve your personal day-to-day working life?\n\n**Bjorn Barnard** : In my role as a Digital Marketing Director at ACCO Brands\nEurope, Optimizely is a platform that I'm very comfortable owning. It delivers\nthe products and the features that the wider team needs at a central level, but\nit's also there to support our local teams.\n\nOptimizely and Wunderman Thompson are our primary partners. Optimizely provides\nthe platform and the features that we require our partnership with Wunderman\nThompson allows our central and local teams to really harness the power of the\nplatform.\n\n### What have you got planned for the future with the Optimizely One platform?\n\n**Bjorn Barnard** : So, together with Wunderman Thompson, we operate a rolling\ndevelopment roadmap. We are heading towards an upgrade of our Optimizely 11 CMS\nto Optimizely 12 and that's huge for us. We're looking forward to the 25%\nperformance increases that Optimizely have promised and shown that has been\ndelivered for other customers.\n\nOur partners at Wunderman Thompson are also very confident that we'll see those\nbenefits ourselves as well. Also, once we've updated to Optimizely 12, we've got\nheadless e-commerce on our radar!\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Commerce Connect\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.accobrands.com/",

    "content": "# NRL brings 19 websites & 7 digital properties under one roof\n\nHow Optimizely is helping transform a scrum of sites into one seamless,\nefficient content hub for millions of visitors every week.\n\n## At a glance\n\n- 34% YoY increase in user base\n- 3 Million average weekly users\n- Significant increase in engagement from fans via NRL app\n\n## Top of their game\n\nThe National Rugby League (NRL) is Australia’s top-level domestic men’s rugby\nleague competition. It contains clubs from the original Sydney club Rugby League\ncompetition, which has been running continuously since 1908.\n\nToday the NRL has over 5.4 million fans in Australia and its digital network is\na hub for all things rugby league. The NRL Premiership attracts about 3 million\npeople to its matches, with more than 100 million viewers on television. Content\nproduction is one of the NRL's key functions as they now see an average 100’s of\nmillion sessions and almost double in page views per year.\n\n## Complex technology infrastructure\n\nWith 19 websites and 7 non-web digital properties such as social media, mobile\napplications, and over-the-top service, NRL receives 4 million visitors per week\nacross its channels.\n\nNRL's decentralised technology infrastructure was holding them back. The old\nplatform had multiple external tools for content management that were not\nintegrated. This created a disruptive workflow, especially for the content team,\ndue to the lack of seamless processes to develop and optimize content across\ndifferent digital properties.\n\nThe lack of advanced integrations and features also meant that there were\nlimitations in the type of content and experiences it could provide to its fans,\nalong with the analytics and intelligence to make the right decisions within\ntheir content production lifecycles.\n\nThe lack of sophisticated features also meant that NRL was publishing blanket\ncontent and unable to understand the data behind its campaigns and promotions.\nEngaging content is subjective: without a customised or personalized experience,\ngreat content can seem haphazard. With no proper data in the mix, it’s a recipe\nfor poor traffic and engagement. Domenic and his team knew that this needed to\nchange.\n\n_\"We needed to connect our content and data together into a central publishing\nplatform from across our business in a way that allows us to produce highly\nvaluable user experiences, giving the NRL network the capability to offer\ntargeted content and commercialisation solutions,\"_ said Domenic Romeo.\n\nWe produce a significant amount of content daily and needed a technology\narchitecture that allowed us to perform this at scale across a network of 19\norganisations including NRL, our Clubs and States.\n\nDomenic Romeo\n\nHead of Technology, National Rugby League\n\n## Unifying technologies into one platform\n\nTo get better control and visibility into its online operations, NRL\ntransitioned all its sites to a consolidated **Optimizely Content\nCloud**solution**.** This gave it a robust, unified and cost-effective CMS,\ninstead of an expensive, overly-complex, legacy technology architecture.\n\nOne of the most important things was to create a seamless workflow by\nconsolidating NRL's owned technologies under a single platform. This has\ntremendously improved work efficiency within the organization and removed a lot\nof work duplication. For example, content syndication was simplified, as the new\nplatform allows the content team to easily create and repurpose each piece of\ncontent depending on the medium to be published, such as mobile and TV apps.\n\nThe tightly integrated network and intuitive user experience made it easier for\nNRL to navigate the new CMS. The **Optimizely Content Management Platform**\nprovides ease of use from creating to publishing content, enabling NRL to post\ninstantaneously, especially when it comes to breaking news. Searching for assets\ncan be difficult especially when there's no proper system in place. However, the\nOptimizely Search & Navigation function made it easy for the content team to\nlocate assets. While these features may sound simple, they can significantly\naffect an organization's productivity.\n\n## Harnessing data for a competitive edge\n\nData has now become an essential part of NRL's online engagement to maximize its\ndigital efforts. Every piece of content is now focused and tailored according to\nNRL's audience segment, leading NRL to double the size of its audience and\nsignificantly increase engagement. The content team can also monitor visitor\nengagement with different websites to better understand their online\nbehaviors.“It’s a very fine system which is easy to use. It was clearly well set\nup with a lot of thought going into it. The drop and drag functions make it easy\nto use and compared to other content management systems it is head and shoulders\nabove the rest that I have used in a few previous newsrooms” says Paul Suttor,\nEditor in Chief NRL.com\n\nUsing the Optimizely CMS has made a significant difference. From increasing team\nproductivity, to reducing infrastructure complexity and ultimately driving\ntraffic and engagement. A robust CMS can help an organization grow. \"It has been\na game-changer for us centralising our architecture around the Optimizely CMS\nplatform. It helped the organization to focus on work that really matters rather\nthan managing complex technology architectures. Now we can better analyse\nvisitor data, generate insights and improve our future and current digital\ninitiatives to fit user demands. All the content we produce is much more\ntargeted and valuable, driving higher engagement. We couldn’t have done this on\nour old systems, moving everything to a single platform has been critical,” said\nQuanah McBride, General Manager – Digital Technology & Operations\n\nRead the National Rugby League 2020 Annual Report here\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://",

With 20 regional distribution centers\nthroughout the United States, Northern Radiator prides itself on delivering\nquality engineered products with quick order turnaround times and superior order\nfilling.\n\nAs end-users began finding new ways to source products and leverage technology\nto research their options, Northern Radiator knew they needed to build a more\nprominent online presence.\n\n## A sales plateau on the old system\n\nNorthern Radiator’s original eCommerce system was a simple transactional\neCommerce site powered by Infor Storefront. The site hit a sales plateau and was\nnot meeting customers’ expectations. Northern Radiator wanted to better serve\nthe needs of their customer base.\n\nConsidering Northern Radiator sells to nearly 30 different customer types, they\nwere challenged with creating relevant and intuitive solutions for both late\nadopters of technology and web-savvy users. They wanted to provide real-time\naccess to availability, pricing and ordering to give their customers the edge\nthey need to compete in today’s market.\n\nThe flexibility with the Episerver B2B Commerce Cloud platform versus the Infor\nplatform, which was the storefront we were on previously, allows us to do\neCommerce the way we want to do business. We don’t have to conform to someone\nelse’s rigid box.\n\nHope Thompson\n\nPresident , Northern Radiator\n\n## Narrowing the search for a better solution\n\nNorthern Radiator settled on Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud because Insite\nSoftware (acquired by Optimizely in December 2019) was taking the time to\nunderstand their business model, future needs and assist in addressing their\nmarket challenges. Northern Radiator appreciated the B2B focus of the Optimizely\nB2B Commerce Cloud platform.\n\nWith Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, Northern Radiator is enabling customers to\nself-serve. Customers can easily sign-in and view information like pricing and\nreal-time inventory.\n\n## Positioned for growth\n\nFor Northern Radiator success means business growth, exceeding customers’\nexpectations and continuous improvement. Today, just over one-third of the\ncompany’s sales comes through their online channel. They are continually\ndeploying new website features to meet customers’ needs.\n\nMany companies like Northern Radiator were built on relationships and\nhandshakes, so tailoring their solutions to customers who prefer to self-serve\nonline proves to be a major shift in business – a challenging but necessary\nendeavor.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.northernfactory.com/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nNishtech Inc\n\nNishtech is a full-service ecommerce and digital experience consultancy and have\nbeen named as Optimizely's Preferred Partner for implementing Optimizely Content\nManagement and Configured Commerce integrated...",

    "content": "# The Country Road Group gets 65% of revenue from mobile\n\n## At a glance\n\n- 210% increase in clicks for anniversary promotion\n- 10% purchase conversion from interface tweaks\n- 65% of revenue now from mobile\n\n## How rapid experimentation drives new ideas and innovation for leading\n\necommerce fashion retailer\n\nThe Country Road Group is one of Australia's largest specialty fashion retailers\nwith a market leading position in the mid to upper tier of the segment.\nComprising five iconic brands - Country Road, Mimco, Trenery, Witchery and\nPolitix - be it modern Australian designs, urban sophistication or accessories\nwith a quirk, each brand has its own inspiring story to tell.\n\nTelling those stories is now easier with Optimizely, creating incredible\nexperiences for customers and key metric uplift to match.\n\n## Finding a better way to test ideas\n\nLike many retailers, the Country Road Group’s online sites have become an\nincreasingly integral part of its business, accelerated by the COVID-19\npandemic. The retailer has begun an ambitious digital transformation journey to\nenhance its site and further grow its online operations. With 1.5 million unique\nvisitors to its online stores every week, even a small conversion increase\ntranslates to a big impact.\n\nThe company had a lot of hypotheses about interface changes to drive clicks and\nconversions, but it needed a better way to run experiments.\n\n\"We’ve developed a roadmap and a robust strategy, but we want to push ourselves\nas hard as possible,\" explains Matthew Horn, General Manager Digital, the\nCountry Road Group. \"Our way of working has become a huge conversation. How can\nwe meaningfully embrace agile? How can we better experiment? Experimentation is\nso pivotal to the agile philosophy.\"\n\n## Faster testing delivers immediate results\n\nThe Country Road Group wanted to overhaul how it worked and experimented. It\nwanted to move faster and test and learn more efficiently. To do this, it joined\nforces with Optimizely as well as its strategic partner, New Republique, a\nspecialist consultancy dedicated to experimentation.\n\nThis enabled Country Road Group to run much faster, more powerful experiments,\ntesting hypotheses and getting immediate feedback to interface tweaks and\nchanges. One experiment involved moving the \"Add to Bag\" button above the\nproduct copy. This saw a 19% rise in clicks to Add to Wishlist and a 6% increase\nin clicks on Add to Bag. Overall, complete purchase conversions rose 2%,\nrepresenting a complete purchase revenue increase of over 5%.\n\nAnother hypothesis was displaying a countdown timer on the Politix brand website\nwould generate an urgency on the customer’s willingness to shop and make a\npurchase. Using Optimizely, the experiment was carried out immediately,\nresulting in a dramatic, instant boost in clicks and conversions. Add to Bag\nrose 4% and complete purchase conversions were up 9%.\n\n## Bright ideas, bold experimentation\n\nThe way the Country Road Group now tests is significantly different from pre-\nCOVID times. Previously, the company took a very conservative approach. Now it\nhas become much bolder with experimentation.\n\nFor example, the Country Road Group has used New Republique and Optimizely to\nenhance special campaigns. For the Witchery brand, a 50th birthday promotion was\ncreated, with the option to personalize a leather bag. Compared to the default\npage, which simply displayed a 50th birthday banner for Witchery, the\nimprovement was dramatic. Clicks on the Homepage block more than doubled (up\n210%), clicks on the original content snippet were up 155% and complete purchase\nwas 77% higher.\n\n\"Our partnership with New Republique has given us real maturity in how we think\nabout experimentation. They provide significant, highly valued thought\nleadership. Over the last six months, it’s been exciting to see New Republique\ngive the value of experimentation a real and authoritative voice, backed up by\nwork they’re doing with brands,\" Matthew says.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nThe Country Road Group is seeing dramatic results from the enhancements it has\nmade so far. Mobile has seen tremendous growth, with 65% of revenue now coming\nfrom that channel.\n\nBy using Optimizely to drive constant improvements to its site, the Country Road\nGroup is able to evolve in step with changing shopper behavior. It’s also better\nable to manage issues such as returns and the supply chain.\n\n“We’ve come a long way, but still have a long way to go. Our culture of\ndelivering everything in ‘waterfall’ fashion was so heavily engrained that the\nappetite for risk was very low. Now people understand that it’s okay to break\nthings when we’re trying new ideas. It’s not just testing and learning, but\ntesting, learning and breaking. Constructive failure through experimentation is\nthe price of progress on the digital front,\" Matthew says.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.countryroadgroup.com.au/",

    "content": "# How charity: water boosts donation size\n\nWhen a visitor makes a donation, they enter how much they’d like to give in a\nbox before providing their payment information. charity: water pre-fills the\ninput box with a suggested donation amount, which used to be $20 or $30.\n\nThe team experimented with increasing the amount to maximize the total money\nraised and found that a better pre-fill for average donation size without\nreducing conversion rate was $60\n\n### Does matching motivate people to donate?\n\nFrom time to time, charity: water matches public donations through another\ndonor. The team tested whether this motivates more people to donate, and were\nsurprised to find that matching didn’t get more people to convert and the\noverall number of visitors who pushed the “Donate” button stayed the same.\n\nHowever, an experiment run over the holidays showed that the average donation\nsize increased by 30% while a match was offered. “When people who are\n[initially] willing to give $50 actually give $65, it scales up into millions of\ndollars over the whole year of donations,” said Scott.\n\nInsights from Optimizely have helped us radically raise more money—millions and\nmillions of dollars online over the years.\n\nScott Harrison\n\nFounder and CEO, charity: water, charity: water\n\n## Simplified sign-up flow for campaigns\n\nFrom day one, charity: water has leveraged the power of social connections (and\nsocial media) to bring people into their cause. They were one of the first\nnonprofits to embrace Snapchat and Instagram, and a central part of their\nfundraising culture is campaigns led by individual evangelists who ask their\nfriends and family to donate. For example, 170,000 people have created birthday\ncampaigns asking for charity: water donations instead of birthday gifts.\n\nThe team experimented with the sign-up flow to start a campaign and saw drop-off\non longer flows. So they tested a very short flow that collected much less\ninformation and was designed to be less intimidating. The result was a 34%\nincrease in clicks on the “Create Campaign” button.\n\n“[This was a] huge, huge win for us. We would have never thought that collecting\nthis amount of information would have deterred people,” said Scott.\n\n### What's next for charity: water\n\nMost individual donors find charity: water, give a gift, and move on. As a\nresult, the nonprofit needs to find up to 85% new donors each year—or, they must\ninvest in programs that keep these community members engaged for recurring\nrevenue.\n\n“The key business challenge for us right now is more repeatable, sustainable\nrevenue so we don't have to start over every single year, and to give an amazing\nexperience to these people with virtual reality and media to bring the stories\ncloser to the donors,” said Scott.\n\nTo that end, charity: water is experimenting with a program in which individuals\ngive monthly to fund clean water projects and sustainability. Even if the\ndonation amount varies—donors can give at any level they are comfortable\nwith—what matters the most are the long-term relationships that are created.\n\n> We're trying to build a team of people who can step into the next 10 years\n> with us as we hope to make an even bigger impact.\n> — Scott Harrison, founder and CEO, charity: water\n\n#### Industry\n\nCharity and non-profits\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.charitywater.org/",

    "content": "# KLM scales its test-and-learn culture with Optimizely\n\nThe best way of knowing is doing. Although KLM Royal Dutch Airlines had always\nbeen pioneering the forefront of digital developments and has always had a\nculture of engaging customers in developing new products and services, KLM’s web\nteams reached the limits of their experimentation capabilities in 2017. As the\nneed for experimentation by internal product teams and data-driven decision\nmaking increased, KLM was looking for a reliable data-driven test partner … and\nfound one in Optimizely.\n\n## Building minimal lovable products\n\nDigital product teams at KLM are continuously working on improvements to the\nuser experience. In an industry that is renown for its competitiveness - many\ndifferent parties are trying to seduce the travel savvy customer - small tweaks\nto the user experience can make a huge difference. With over 30 million people\nbooking KLM tickets on a yearly basis, building a product that ‘just works’ (a\nMinimal Viable Product) is not enough, it is about building digital products\nthat are super easy to use and intuitive - Minimal Lovable Product.\n\nThis is no easy feat and requires a lot of user engagement, feedback and testing\nto implement. KLM therefore implemented Optimizely to scale the number and\nimpact of experiments done by the different product teams. Now, a year-and-a-\nhalf after implementation, 6 product teams use Optimizely. Overall, KLM doubled\nthe number of tests executed and on average the time to set up a test only takes\nhalf the time it did before Optimizely’s implementation.\n\nWe are catching up with Grazia Aroboleo and Joost Olieroock within KLM’s\nCustomer Insights & Analytics team to talk about the implementation.\n\n## Optimizing the customer experience\n\nThe introduction of Optimizely within KLM just coincided with a KLM-wide program\nto roll out flight packages (incorporating baggage and ticket flexibility) in\nthe booking flow. When Grazia Arboleo, Optimization Specialist within the\nInsights & Analytics team at KLM, was asked to AB-test a new design for the\nflight selection step on the KLM website with these new packages, she did not\nknow that this would be an important turning point in the way design changes\nwould be rolled out.\n\nThe team focused on building an Minimal Lovable Product based on flexible\ncomponents. This would allow fast optimization and was the requirement for an\nagile rollout. Grazia helped the team to track the impact of the new design\nthrough experimentation. Despite high expectations, the experiment data showed\nclearly that the new design needed further optimization.\n\nGrazia and the team analyzed the results and developed new hypotheses.\nOptimizely enabled them to run multiple experiments easily, iterate quickly and\nmake step-by-step improvements to the design. Within a few months, the team ran\nmore than 20 tests on this particular flow-always measuring step conversion and\nbooking conversion rates. Some of the experiments delivered clear winners,\nothers did not. As a result, conversion rates recovered and finally, the\nexperience was rolled out to all visitors.\n\nPrior to using Optimizely, KLM used to implement redesigns gradually, starting\nby serving the experience to a small geographic market. If the teams did not see\ndrastic changes in their analytics or sales figures for this market, they would\ngradually expand the experience to other markets. This roll-out process could\nhelp to prevent drastic drops in measurements, but more subtle changes were hard\nto detect.\n\n## Accelerating the Experimentation Mindset\n\nThis first successful, experiment received a lot of attention within KLM and\nhelped to drive the experimentation mindset further “It was crucial for us to be\nable to measure the differences between the old and the new versions of the\nbooking flow and get reliable statistical data”, says Grazia.\n\nThe ease of setting up experiments in Optimizely has encouraged other product\nteams at KLM to engage with experimentation. “Prior we had third parties\ndeveloping most of our experiments. Nowadays we have our own developers doing\nthis. When new developers start using Optimizely, they are often amazed about\nthe possibilities. It is also great that experimentation makes the impact of\ntheir daily work much clearer. The analysts from Grazia’s team support the\nproduct teams throughout the complete experimentation process (from plan to\nanalysis). “The team I support is now submitting more test requests than I can\nanalyze”, Grazia laughs and is glad that Optimizely’s Stats Engine, the\nstatistical backbone of the platform, makes her life as an analyst a lot easier.\nShe is proud that her product team adopted an experimentation mindset and is\ntesting self-sufficiently as part of their agile way of working.\n\nProduct owners now ask more and more to test every change to prove that it does\nwhat it is supposed to do - and if not, we can optimize. These learnings are\ncrucial for delivering a convincing customer experience.\n\nJoost Olieroock\n\nManager Customer Insights & Analytics, KLM\n\n## Data draws a detailed picture of the customer\n\nBesides experimentation, the teams are also gaining insights from other data\nsources (e.g. analytics, surveys, heatmaps). Optimizely's integration with some\nof their tools, helps them to get a better understanding of customer needs and\nsee if the variations in their experiments better fulfill these needs.\n\nThe integration with the Analytics tool allows KLM to automatically import\nexperiment data for further analysis within a wider business context. Also\nheatmaps can be automatically tagged with the information about the A/B test\nvariation that a particular user has seen. This way the analysts can\ndifferentiate between experiences during their analysis.\n\nJoost brings up the project for KLM’s Corporate program to optimize the\nexperience of business travellers by providing",

This way the analysts can\ndifferentiate between experiences during their analysis.\n\nJoost brings up the project for KLM’s Corporate program to optimize the\nexperience of business travellers by providing them with a special booking flow\nfor corporate customers. “This a perfect example where we used insights from\nuser feedback, analytics and experimentation in conjunction.”\n\nBefore developing the experience, the team wanted to draw a picture of this\nparticular segment and understand how they like to engage with the site. To\ndecide if and how to build the experience, the team ran an experiment with\nOptimizely to find out, if users were actually willing to disclose whether they\nwere travelling for leisure or business by adding an option to specify the\nreason for travel. They also conducted a survey asking users to fill in a\nquestionnaire about their booking preferences. The results were complemented\nwith data from their analytics tool.\n\nWhile the project has not yet been completed, the research has lead to the\nhypothesis that users might be more willing to reveal their reason for travel if\nthey knew what the information would be used for and how it would benefit them.\n\nThis example shows how data from various sources of research helps to gain\ninsights on users’ needs and preferences and how experiments help optimizing the\nexperience of visitors.\n\n## A new way of learning\n\nThe scale and speed of experimentation with Optimizely has changed the way\ndigital product teams at KLM are working. “Optimizely is really helping our\nteams to test and learn faster, making it easier to adapt to our customer\nneeds”, says Grazia. “Testing is very important to measure the impact of changes\ntowards our goal”, she adds.\n\nJoost predicts that experimentation will soon be the gold standard across all\nteams at KLM, as it allows KLM to catch potential pitfalls before they are\nrolled out to all users. “Product owners now ask more and more to test every\nchange to prove that it does what it is supposed to do - and if not, we can\noptimize.

    "content": "# How experimentation drives donations for the UK’s biggest charity\n\n## At a glance\n\n- 294% improvement of click through rate\n- 25M visitors per year\n\n## How experimentation, recommendations and training are driving donations for\n\nthe UK’s biggest charity\n\nIn 2017, the “About Cancer” section of Cancer Research UK’s website amassed over\n25 million visitors. The same year the charity raised over £30 million through\nits online fundraising platform alone - this is why its online presence is so\nimportant. Providing a high quality digital experience to both external\nstakeholders – such as fundraisers, cancer patients and the general public – as\nwell as employees, is non-negotiable.\n\n## Becoming digital masters\n\nAs a data-driven non-profit organization that prides itself on world-leading\nresearch capabilities, Cancer Research UK took a scientific approach to\nimproving its digital offerings. The team identified clear challenges: Without\nimproved user experience, smarter navigation and a clearer page layout, the\ncharity would miss out on many valuable donations through the course of the\nyear.\n\nTo test ideas for improvements to the digital experience, the charity is using\nexperimentation. The team counts on the Optimizely experimentation platform to\ngenerate the insights necessary to improve user experience and maximize the\ndesired outcome for the organization.\n\nWe are encouraging a culture of testing and learning through experimentation\nwhich initially we had to fight for. After running the first experiments, our\nstakeholders had a lightbulb moment. They did not have to take our word for it,\nbut look at the Optimizely data. The figures were a compelling argument to\ncontinue experimenting.\n\nJosie Downey\n\nUser Experience Designer, Cancer Research UK\n\n## Finding the answers\n\nAlongside Optimizely, Cancer Research UK set out to increase awareness and drive\na cohesive message both before and during World Cancer Day 2017, an annual event\nin which the charity encourages the public to unite in the fight against cancer.\n\nA/B testing of user interaction with Cancer Research UK’s corresponding landing\npage revealed excessive noise and undefined call-to-actions to be a key factor\nimpacting user engagement. Ultimately, the existing user interface was\ndetrimental to the goals of the campaign, directly impacting Cancer Research\nUK’s fundraising efforts.\n\nThe team developed a second version of the landing page during the campaign\nperiod to test out user interaction. The amended version reduced noise and\nstreamlined the user journey to allow for clearer communication and calls-to-\naction.\n\n## Proof is the donations\n\nCancer Research UK found that testing its landing page significantly improved\nthe digital experience and ensured users were able to navigate the site with\nease. Over the World Cancer Day 2017 campaign period, Cancer Research UK was\nable to increase the click through rate through testing by 294%.\n\nCritically, the success of the campaign helped internal marketing and management\nteams to understand and recognize the value of online experiments. This has led\nto increased internal support for experimentation in future projects.\n\n## Building the future through research and experimentation\n\nIn the short-term, Cancer Research UK is planning to introduce online chat\nfunctionality to reduce the volume of calls to its call centre, providing an\nall-around digital experience for end users. The charity is also actively\nfocusing its efforts on ensuring that it is moving multiple core operations\nonline, such as donations and grant applications.\n\nSince the overwhelming success of the campaign, Cancer Research UK has further\nexpanded its digital centre of excellence. The charity’s culture of\nexperimentation now extends across every department, from junior to senior\nmembers of staff, empowering the entire organization to learn new skills and try\ntheir hand at experimentation to improve every aspect of the digital experience.\n\nThe introduction of internal initiatives such as ‘UX hour’, a daily hour-long\nknowledge-sharing session where employees come together to bounce off digitally-\nled ideas and suggestions, is a testament to Cancer Research UK’s bold approach\nto embedding experimentation into its culture.\n\nThe charity is focused on becoming even more effective at raising money,\neducating the public and shaping policies in an effort to save more lives.\nExperimentation will continue to play a major role in the team meeting these\ngoals, for a charity that is setting the standard in the sector.\n\n#### Industry\n\nCharity and non-profits\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.cancerresearchuk.org/",

Panagopoulos\n\nVP, Global Strategic Alliances, GlobalLink\n\n## The Solution\n\nIn need of a translation management solution to cover all sites, Coloplast opted\nfor the GlobalLink Connect Add-on for Optimizely. Through this automation, the\nsubmission of content needing translation and the subsequent retrieval of\ncontent post translation resulted in hundreds of operational hours saved. This\nwas attributed as the most effective way of achieving the key objective; making\na more streamlined process of managing and launching a multilingual site.\n\nWorking in close partnership with Translations.com and Optimizely Premium\nPartner Valtech, the teams illustrated the system architecture based on the\nOptimizely solutions. This would act as a support for translation management\ntechnologies. This was tightly managed by the project management team in\nassociation with the Coloplast Digital Communications team.\n\nWith the implementation of GlobalLink Connect for Optimizely, Coloplast have\nentered the next stage of digital readiness. By running the necessary\ninfrastructure and language services this solution provides, Coloplast are\npositioned to take products to market quicker than previously. Launches happens\nin weeks opposed to months, meaning they can react and deploy fast, standing out\nagainst competition.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

One\nof the main objectives for the new platform, was to simplify the enhancement\nprocess. The solution also had to provide equivalent functionality, while\nstreamlining the authoring process for content editors.\n\nThe new solution required existing compatibility and pre-built integration with\nSalesforce CRM and Salesforce Marketing Cloud marketing automation, along with\nthe ability to deliver an authenticated broker portal to supply access to\nspecific content and tools.\n\nIt has been remarkable that we have essentially built three years of capability\nin three months.\n\nGary Boyd\n\nHead of Digital, Pepper Group\n\n## The Solution\n\nPepper evaluated a number of vendors and selected Optimizely's Digital\nExperience Platform service for CMS and marketing due to the platform's full\ncompliance with Pepper's requirements, approach to integration with the broader\ndigital ecosystem, and some other differentiating features.\n\nAs Pepper's previous CMS was hosted and managed by a partner agency, they\ninitially considered a third-party hosting provider; however, concerns around\nde-centralized responsibility and additional effort to manage all parties\ninvolved led them to instead consider the Digital Experience Cloud - a PaaS\noffering that is full managed and hosted by Optimizely.\n\nThe customer felt that the PaaS offering would reduce the number of partners\ninvolved in the project and guaranteed them stable and robust performance. The\nscalable infrastructure was something that they felt differentiated Optimizely,\nas well as the diminished requirement for infrastructure across their global\noperations in UK, Ireland and Australia.\n\nThe benefits they identified included:\n\n- A single vendor for both application and hosting\n- Elastic scaling of resources when visitor numbers fluctuate\n- A Dev/Ops capability that could be leveraged for their development\n- The Azure web-apps architecturefor improvements in security and vulnerability management\n- Guaranteed SLA for uptime and performance\n\n## The Result\n\nAs a challenger brand in many of their markets, Pepper sees Digital and Customer\nExperience as a key differentiator for its brokers and customers. Pepper\nselected Optimizely for many of the leading capabilities that they believe will\nsupport their ambitions with acquistion, improve customer and broker service and\nallow them to engage with their stakeholders.

The organization respond to around 500,000\nemergency calls each year, charting their paramount importance to the wellbeing\nof New Zealand's residents.\n\n## Growing pains of transitioning to a digital-first organization\n\nBeing one of the largest handlers of cheques in New Zealand, and with a range of\nfragmented digital experiences and a large number of customers in older\ndemographic groups, St John were aware that their transition into a digital-\nfirst organization was not going to be an overnight transformation.\n\nSome significant challenges included an abundance of legacy systems along with\nmanual processing and workarounds that had led them to a digital dead-end. The\nteam also had to contend with very limited resources and limited digital skills\nwithin the organization, causing them to miss opportunities to engage with\ncustomers and gain valuable insights from across their digital footprint. They\nrequired an intelligent platform that would aid their knowledge and help grow\ntheir marketing operations.\n\n## Proactively making customers proactive\n\nSt John soon grasped that in order to improve customer engagement with their\nsite, they needed to reengineer their operations, with a focus on customer\nexperience, automation, integration and digital capabilities that could be\nreused across their business units. This way there would be less need for their\ncustomers to call, write-in or stand in line to receive basic information or\nmake transactions that could be delivered online, as well as providing St John\nwith the ability to drive revenue and engagement whilst reducing operational\ncosts and churn.\n\nWe're incredibly excited to be able to leverage the capabilities of Episerver\nDXC [now Optimizely] in order to deliver class-leading digital experiences, and\n– with Optimizely’s tireless support – we’re looking forward to implementing\nmore features (AI-driven recommendations, content personalization, etc.) as our\nown capabilities grow.\n\nAdi Wickramaratne\n\nDigital Manager, St John New Zealand\n\n## Delivering a new digital vision\n\nToday, St John are leveraging Optimizely Commerce Cloud to help deliver their\ntransformational digital vision.

    "content": "# Blomsterlandet creates a blooming ecommerce experience\n\n## Growing plant sales, online\n\nSince Blomsterlandet was founded in 1989, entrepreneurship, expertise and a\npassion for gardening have driven the company to become Sweden’s largest\nretailer of flowers and plants. They have 63 stores across the country and a\nstrong brand within the industry.\n\nBy challenging themselves, listening to their customers' needs and having the\ncourage to push forward constantly, Blomsterlandet has succeeded in innovating\nsignificantly over the last 30 years. When global digital agency, Valtech,\nstarted the collaboration with Blomsterlandet, they were facing their biggest\nchallenge ever - to transform the business digitally and meet the needs of their\ncustomers of tomorrow.\n\nBlomsterlandet is a Swedish chain with 61 stores from Malmö in the south to\nLuleå in the north. Customers can also buy online. In Blomsterlandet’s stores\nyou can buy everything from a simple tulip to large flower arrangements for the\nwedding of your dreams. Blomsterlandet buys its plants directly from the grower,\nsimplifying the supply chain. The idea is to provide locally cultivated plants,\nfirst and foremost.\n\nWhen Blomsterlandet came to Valtech, they already had an ecommerce solution in\nplace, but it no longer met their needs for speed, responsiveness and a seamless\nshopping experience.\n\nAt the same time, the florist landscape was experiencing new competition and was\nincreasing adopting online commerce. Blomsterlandet needed to increase its\ndigital presence to meet customer demands.\n\n## Knowledge - the key to attract customers\n\nIn addition to its large variety of plants, it became clear in Valtech's\ndiscovery work that knowledge and advice form an important part of\nBlomsterlandet’s offering. Enabling customers to learn about how to grow and\ncultivate plants by providing advice and guides was a key part of making the\nentire offering available digitally. The team was faced with new types of\nquestions and design challenges such as: how to design an ecommerce site that\ninspires and guides customers? How to combine Blomsterlandet’s expertise with\ntheir products?\n\nIt’s a given, but it cannot be overstated - purchasing behaviours and challenges\ndiffer in different industries. Target groups and their driving forces can vary\ngreatly. For this reason, Valtech interviewed a lot of customers in the\nDiscovery Phase - both those who shopped in-store and those who shopped online.\nAfter the interviews, the responses were analysed, and then Valtech went back to\nthe digital drawing board and started to ideate and work on the solution.\n\nAmong the insights, Valtech identified that many customers worried that flowers\nthey were buying online would wither in transit. Therefore it was important the\ndesign and content of the site made it clear to the customer that Blomsterlandet\nhad expertise in shipping plants and knows how to handle plants to ensure the\nwell-being of the plants.\n\n## Technical platform\n\nBlomsterlandet’s previous solution could no longer meet the demands of\nBlomsterlandet’s customers or internal stakeholders, and it did not have the\nfeatures and capabilities you would expect from a modern ecommerce solution.\nWith their new technical platform, Blomsterlandet can now take the next step to\ndevelop both ecommerce and service offerings to reach new target groups.\n\nBy gathering data from multiple sources in an “Integration Hub”, it is possible\nto build new solutions for channels other than ecommerce - for example, apps and\nin-store solutions. Valtech also focussed heavily on making the site fast and\nresponsive. This was made possible by building the front-end in React, while the\nback-end has been developed in Optimizely Commerce.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Content Management System\n- Commerce Connect\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.blomsterlandet.se/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nValtech SE\n\nValtech is the experience innovation company.",

    "content": "# Swedish Red Cross simplified online work and increased conversion\n\n## An online Red Cross, fit for a new generation\n\nCalling the Red Cross digital platform a 'website' is a serious understatement.\nDespite a limited budget, the Red Cross took a holistic approach and created a\nmulti-site online platform. The following were built in one and the same\nproject: an external web; an intranet; a website for face-to-face fundraisers;\nan editing interface for local volunteers with limited online skills; and, last\nbut not least, a modern e-commerce solution for fundraising.\n\nOver time, the Red Cross had acquired a ragtag of websites for different\npurposes and target groups. Managing all these technical solutions was both\ndifficult and expensive, quite apart from the underwhelming visitor experience.\nSo the project \"An Online Red Cross\" was launched in order to create a platform-\nwide and modern solution, with a number of underlying integrations. It was a\nmulti-year project dedicated to making the most of digitalization opportunities\nfrom the perspective of visitors and users.\n\nThe project started with an effect map to ensure that the different needs of all\nstakeholders would be accommodated in the solution. The key stakeholders were:\n\n- People wishing to donate money—private individuals or businesses\n- People wishing to become volunteers\n- People wishing for assistance\n- People wishing to locate Red Cross thrift stores\n- People involved in the Red Cross\n- People recruiting monthly donors face-to-face\n- People volunteering to work with local communication.\n\n## Improved communication, reduced complexity and increased fundraising via\n\ndigital channels\n\nRequirements from the various stakeholders were collected and used as a basis\nfor the solution, alongside clear prioritization from the steering group. Target\ngroups who access the Red Cross websites are individual online visitors who\nsometimes go from one status to another—e.g. from donor to volunteer.\n\nEverything being built also had to be 'mobile first', where the experience not\nonly needed to be adapted for mobile visitors, but also adapted to work as\neffective tools for face-to-face recruiters and local online editors. Given the\nmany different target groups, the transparency requirements, and the hundreds of\nactive editors, the digital channels needed to be able to manage a high level of\ncomplexity, while the interface and user experience were of paramount\nimportance. Add to this the people seeking assistance from the Red Cross, for\nexample, to find missing family members or get support in a national\ncrisis—which also calls for simplicity in a complex world.\n\nThe outcome was an integrated digital platform built on Optimizely, where a\nmobile recruitment platform simplified the work of face-to-face recruiters. A\ncompletely new external website that is better equipped to provide aid seekers\nwith the support they need, at the same time as it channels involved visitors to\nsign up as either volunteers or donors. A modern e-commerce solution was built\nwhich improved digital fundraising efforts, and an open intranet designed to\nhelp volunteers, elected representatives, members and other people nationwide\nget more involved with the Red Cross. In addition, 280 local websites are\nintegrated with our CRM system and for which the Red Cross has built a user-\nfriendly interface for volunteer local editors.\n\nNow that the project has been completed, the development of the websites will\ncontinue based on analysis and data. The Red Cross is already seeing that the\nwebsite is delivering excellent results, which is confirmed by our data and\nvisitor surveys carried out by the Red Cross.\n\nThe platform for face-to-face recruiters was launched in January 2019. The\nexternal website went live in July 2019, the internal website in December 2019,\nand the local websites in December 2020. The solution includes as many as 280\nlocal websites that are integrated with our CRM system and for which the Red\nCross has built a user-friendly interface for volunteer local editors.\n\n#### Industry\n\nTech\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.rodakorset.se/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nADACA Authority AB\n\nVi är en digital fullservicebyrå i Stockholm som är specialister på skapa\naffärsnytta för våra uppdragsgivare.",

Every day the company's 1,900 employees serve up to\n50,000 passengers.\n\nCopenhagen airports recognized that travel can be stressful, and with so many\npeople travelling in and out every day, the company decided they needed a\ncomplete workaround of the digital customer experience to better serve their\nneeds. The company decided to create online touchpoints for customers, including\nduty-free pre-order, flight and passenger information, and the ability to\nresearch and book parking. Two of the key goals were to help customers make\nquicker purchasing decisions in the shopping center and make it easier to pick\nup pre-ordered goods.\n\nWe've seen the spend at around two and a half times higher than what they spend\ncoming to the airport.

In the digital age, the idea of ‘knowing your customer’ translates into\nknowing precisely who needs what at which moment in time. Optimizely provided a\nunified platform for shopping, flight and passenger information, parking,\nmembers lounge information and special offers, all within a single sign on.\nUsing Optimizely’s solutions, Optimizely partner, Valtech, designed a smooth and\npersonalized omni-channel customer journey, offering opportunities for increased\nengagement time and thus, business opportunities.\n\nCopenhagen airports now identifies opportunities for engagement at every\ntouchpoint.

    "content": "# George T Sanders increases web traffic by over 100%\n\nThe largest supplier of copper pipe in Colorado upgrades their customer\nexperience with B2B Commerce Cloud\n\n## Taking customer-first to a new level\n\nAs companies grow, they sometimes lose their personal, human touch with\ncustomers. That’s not the case for George T. Sanders (GTS). Although GTS has\ngrown from a small sheet metal supply company to one of the largest suppliers of\ncopper pipe in the state of Colorado, they’ve never lost touch with what’s\ndriven their success – putting their customers first.\n\nFor 70 years, GTS has infused customer-centricity into their culture and in each\nand every employee. As customers’ expectations and preferences have evolved, GTS\nhas adjusted accordingly to best serve them. GTS is the largest privately owned\ndistributor of copper pipe in Colorado, but they have their eyes set on becoming\nthe largest in the region. To best serve their customers and accomplish their\ngrowth goals, they needed a powerful B2B eCommerce solution.\n\n## Upgrading from an ERP storefront\n\nAs a distributor ahead of the game, GTS leveraged Infor Storefront for some\ntime. However, it was not bringing the value they wanted to derive out of a B2B\neCommerce solution. To move the business into the future, GTS assembled an\neCommerce comprised of Natalie Scully, eCommerce Manager and Jordan Ullom, IT\nManager. Both proved to be instrumental in transforming the digital strategy for\nGTS.\n\nScully identified key eCommerce requirements and vetted multiple platforms to\ndetermine the best fit for GTS. She led eCommerce from conception to launch, and\ncontinues to manage the website and mobile app today.\n\nUllom played a key role in ensuring technology systems were integrated properly\nto the eCommerce site. He continues to ensure everything is running properly and\ndata is shared across systems.\n\nGTS also relied heavily on their membership in Affiliated Distributors. They\ndiscussed eCommerce strategy and platform options with multiple AD members to\ngain perspectives about their eCommerce needs. Learning which platforms were\nactually helping make a fundamental difference in moving other independent\ndistributors’ businesses forward played a crucial role in the company’s\neCommerce decision making.\n\nComparing Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud to our previous solution is like\ncomparing apples and oranges. Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud has already brought\nfar more value.\n\nJordan Ullum\n\nIT Manager, George T Sanders\n\n## An eCommerce experience powered by Optimizely Configured Commerce\n\nGTS launched their eCommerce website in October 2019, under budget and in less\nthan one year after selecting Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud.\n\nDeploying the website was never about replacing the sales team or eliminating\nhuman interaction. GTS wasn’t trying to be Amazon, they just wanted to make it\neasier for their customers to do business with them. They wanted to provide the\nexperiences their customers were asking for.\n\nGeorge T. Sanders’ customers reacted very positively to the new site, while\nencouraging the company to do even more. Today, customers are consistently\nproviding feedback about new features that would be nice to incorporate. As\ncustomers provide feedback about the website, GTS makes changes to best\naccommodate them. Customer service is a part of their mantra, after all.\n\nIn August 2019, GTS also went live on Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud Mobile.\nToday, customers enjoy an intuitive app that enables them to quickly and easily\norder plumbing, HVAC and electrical supplies. Plus, customers can view stock,\npricing, spec sheets, account balances and more whether in the field, warehouse,\nhome or office.\n\n## Online sales and transactions are increasing\n\nSince implementation, GTS has seen increased online sales and transactions. Web\ntraffic has increased by over 100%.\n\nIn addition to making customers jobs’ easier, the website has made the GTS team\nmore efficient. Staff members are now freed up to provide better customer\nservice. They aren’t being tied up looking up product information or order\nstatus. Counter workers aren’t manually entering as many orders. They aren’t\nreceiving as many phone calls and lines aren’t as long at the branches. By\nremoving much of the low value tasks the team had to do within a day, they are\nnow available to provide strategic advice, make product recommendations and help\ncustomers solve problems. The team has more time to do what they love doing,\nhelping their customers improve their business.\n\nFrom Storefront to Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, customers are happier, the\nteam is more efficient and business is flourishing.\n\nGTS is 100% committed to providing the best possible experiences for their\ncustomers. They’re continuously taking customer feedback and incorporating\nchanges to the site and the mobile app. Next up? They’re working toward\nintegrating the website with Billtrust so customer invoices can be paid online.\n\nAs George T. Sanders improves their digital experience, Optimizely will be right\nbeside them helping them scale.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.gtsanders.com/",

Based in Minnesota, U.S.,\nAmeriPride prides themselves on servicing those they consider “the backbone of\nthe country”.\n\nAmeriPride provides a wide variety of goods and services which means the buying\nexperience varies from customer-to-customer. Some uniforms need to be highly\ncustomized, some are purchased and some are rented. Not to mention, AmeriPride\noffers a range of other products including disposable gloves and floor mats.\n\nIn an old school industry, AmeriPride’s willingness to adapt and evolve to\ngrowing needs and technologies has given them a competitive edge in the market.\nThey ventured into eCommerce to provide personalized experiences for their\ncustomers.\n\n## Leveraging Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud to support hundreds of eStores\n\nAmeriPride is leveraging a single instance of Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud to\nsupport hundreds of their eStores, which are catered specifically to the unique\nneeds of specific customers and customized with their own brand look and feel,\nproduct catalog and pricing. In addition, larger customers are given the ability\nto use their own images and configure employee-specific budgets to control\nspending.\n\nWith more than 150 stores live, customers have the ability to order customer-\nbranded clothing, including custom embroidery and logo elements. AmeriPride’s\nmarketing team creates each of these sites without any additional help. In\naddition, AmeriPride leverages B2B Commerce Cloud to power a customer portal,\nwhere over 100,000 AmeriPride customers can access order history, invoices,\npayments and more.\n\n## Less hassle, more value\n\nFor many AmeriPride customers, dealing with paper invoices is an artifact of the\npast. Before the introduction of Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, customers\nfrequently had to produce their own orders and fax them into AmeriPride. With\nordering moved online, customers and AmeriPride’s team can spend more time and\nenergy on more important issues. Invoices are hosted and tracked online.\n\nLeveraging Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud has also expedited the order renting\nprocess. Before eCommerce, renting was a complicated process that began with\ncalling a location. Now renting and ordering can be done quickly and easily\nonline.\n\n## Extraordinary business value\n\nAmeriPride’s eStores allowed them to quickly establish new sales channels,\nincrease sales with existing customers and improve customer acquisition in new\nmarkets.\n\nSince launch, the company web store has contributed more than $3 million in\nrevenue each quarter. Microsites contribute more than $10 million in revenue per\nquarter. AmeriPride estimates that the customer portal is saving customer\nservice representatives more than 40,000 hours of work annually.\n\nAmeriPride believes that their integration of Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud has\nput their company in a better position to maintain long-term success. Going\nforward, AmeriPride wants to continue being ahead of the industry, despite being\none of the oldest businesses.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.ameripride.com/",

Dura-\nLine became an established key player in datacom infrastructure, and expanded\ntheir operations in cities across the US and Europe. Today, their business is\nvital to supporting growing telecom infrastructure that supports fiber\nconnections for consumers.

Together, they\ncraft the organization's internal communications and portray the Dura-Line brand\nstory. Optimizely Partner, delaware were brought onboard to help orchestrate a\ndigital ecosystem to improve all aspects of Dura-Line's digital estate, with the\nmost pressing comprising of, a new CMS, PIM and DAM.\n\nDura-Line had an unreliable set of tools for their international site. Around 10\nCMS systems clogged together, producing a ''not so elegant'' digital experience\nfor their technically minded audience.\n\nWhether a distributor, contractor or engineer, visitors often know what they\nwere looking for and required different pieces of information along their\njourney. Dura-Line designed their website to handle all these requests, and\nprovide a vast amount of relevant information along the way.\n\n## The digital ecosystems to address digital latency\n\nAfter appointing delaware, Dura-Line kicked off their digital masterplan by\ngetting a PIM in place to deal will the mass of product information. Dura-Line\nselected inRiver for its smooth integration into the Optimizely platform. This\nwas followed by identifying the right DAM to act as the operational data storage\nlayer.

The company's highly\ncoveted products are certified MADE SAFEⓇ, the most comprehensive ingredient\nsafety certification available. True Botanicals sustainably and ethically\nsources clean ingredients whilst also prioritizing recyclable and reusable\npackaging.\n\nTrue Botanicals has successfully overhauled its brand image, creative output and\npositioning in just two years, from targeting more mature audiences to focusing\non “skintellectuals” who invest in skincare and are keenly interested in the\nappearance and health of their skin. utilizing Optimizely’s Web Experimentation\nplatform has helped the team make data-informed decisions throughout their brand\nredesign.\n\nThe team’s success was recognized by Newsweek’s 2022 list as one of the fastest-\ngrowing shops in the U.S. in 2022, and has now been complimented by a successful\nSeries B investment in March 2023.\n\n## **The evolving landscape of the luxury skincare industry**\n\nAs a nascent brand in the competitive luxury skincare market, Chief Marketing\nOfficer, Rebecca Boston, shared that the entire team was laser focused on making\nTrue Botanicals a cult brand with differentiated, unique positioning that\nconnected deeply with its consumers.\n\nVP of Marketing Tran Wu shared that the company’s vision was to turn their\nwebsite into a best-in-class luxury storefront that was a conversion-driving\nmachine on mobile. One of the team’s biggest challenges was navigating Apple’s\nsweeping privacy changes as it impacted ads and campaigns. This elevated the\nimportance of transforming True Botanicals’ website into a conversion-optimized\ntouchpoint. To achieve that, they needed A/B testing to move the business\nforward.\n\nBefore True Botanicals’ experimentation transformation, business decisions were\nlargely made according to well-known industry best practices, opinions and gut\ninstinct. However, the team was well-aware of constantly evolving customer\nexpectations.\n\nOver 75% of customers access the True Botanicals website on their smartphones.\nTran detailed that True Botanicals’ strategy will always be to “think mobile-\nfirst and obsess over the entire consumer journey” and stressed the importance\nof continuous testing to validate decisions rather than working based on\nstandard industry practices.\n\nWith new competitors challenging the norms of the industry, the need to make\ndata-driven decisions to maximize conversion, retain current customers and\nattract new customers was critical. Therefore, the True Botanicals team\npartnered with Optimizely and its Web Experimentation platform for its website\nrebrand.\n\n## **Implementing A/B testing into True Botanicals’ DNA**\n\nTrue Botanicals identified Anatta as its Optimizely implementation partner\nthanks to the latter’s robust experience implementing Optimizely’s Web\nExperimentation platform with prominent direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands.\n\nBoth teams quickly got acquainted and proceeded to work closely to rebrand True\nBotanicals and optimize the website to drive conversions.\n\nWhen it came time to dive into experimentation, the team decided to switch from\nGoogle Optimize to Optimizely’s Web Experimentation platform. Optimizely’s\nplatform was ultimately chosen for its ability to execute AI-powered\npersonalization along with web A/B testing.\n\nThe team went from running singular tests to multiple tests which helped them\nachieve statistical significance to make data-driven decisions. Constant\ncommunication between True Botanicals and Anatta and regular ideation sessions\nwith Optimizely helped everyone stay on top of testing priorities.\n\nTrue Botanicals’ vision of turning their website into a mobile conversion-\ndriving machine was spearheaded by a 3-pronged CRO testing philosophy.\n\n1. Increase mobile conversion rate by 25%\n2. CRO is a game of inches: it takes a series of tests to improve conversion rate over time.\n3. Prioritize tests closest to conversion and use the PXL method to focus on the highest impact tests\n\nPrinciple Creative Director at Anatta, Ruben Oviedo, shared that Optimizely’s\nindustry-leading capabilities, user-friendly interface, and strong partnership\nmade it easy for the team to test at a higher velocity and gain better insights\ninto True Botanicals’ customers.\n\nRuben also shared that the ability to seamlessly test for mobile-first\nexperiences has transformed True Botanical’s testing capabilities. The team can\nnow test throughout the customer journey, aiding True Botanicals on its way to\nachieve its conversion goals.\n\nKatie Smith (UX Designer – Anatta) commented that “the platform is really easy\nto use and looking for data and results is a straightforward process.” Instead\nof the team’s prior process of extracting information piecemeal, they can now\nhave a holistic summary as well as extract highlights to identify test winners\nswiftly.\n\nWe were laser focused on creating the most seamless and frictionless shopping\nexperience for our consumers.

CommScope was\nlisted on the NASDAQ stock exchange in October 2013.\n\nEquipped with almost five decades of experience, CommScope is an expert in\nconnecting people, enabling smart locations, and providing world-class solutions\nfor network providers.\n\nIn April 2019, CommScope acquired ARRIS, growing the company to 30,000 workers,\n15,000 patents, and $850 million in annual R&D spending.\n\nWith over 30 distribution centers spanning 20 countries and a growing portfolio,\nit was important for CommScope to provide its customers with up-to-date\ninformation coupled with an intuitive customer journey in a unified manner.\n\nCommScope’s impact in connecting the world was recognized in 2020 when the\ncompany was named a Wi-Fi Alliance® Industry Impact Award recipient. The award\nhonors exemplary member companies in the Wi-Fi industry.\n\n## CommScope's need for world-class technology to keep up with its growing\n\nportfolio of companies\n\nWith its complex offering spanning from network infrastructure to software\nsupport, CommScope has to ensure that customers find the information they\nneed—when, where and how they need it.\n\nIn addition, CommScope’s go-to-market strategy meant more websites to maintain.\nCommScope needed a secure, always-on solution that customers can access anytime,\nanywhere.\n\nSenior Director of Customer Experience Technologies, Bob Vonderheide, shared\nthat CommScope’s growing portfolio saw various applications coming together.\nCommScope required a solution with excellent integration options to ensure a\nseamless experience for internal and external stakeholders.\n\nWith a diverse customer base, CommScope’s process for delivering relevant\ninformation to the right user groups had to be facilitated by personalization\ncapabilities, something it lacked.\n\nHowever, it was challenging for CommScope to achieve its goals due to outdated\ntechnology that could not execute CommScope’s vision, shared Director of Digital\nCommunications, Keri Becker.\n\n## Connecting CommScope stakeholders with Optimizely\n\nCommScope’s customer-centric digital strategy and technological overhaul was a\nhuge undertaking. The team wanted partners for strategic initiatives that would\nhelp them expedite timelines and execution. The team landed on Optimizely as its\npreferred digital solutions provider and The C2 Group as its initial\nimplementation partner. C2 helped CommScope start with Optimizely via in-depth\ntraining and laying the foundation in line with the best practices of CX. Since\nthe initial launch, CommScope has also worked with Adage Technologies and\nRightpoint on other strategic initiatives. CommScope procured Optimizely’s\nworld-class CMS and Content Recommendations. Optimizely CMS runs on Azure cloud\ncomputing platform, improving CommScope’s site scalability, speed, and security.\nThe CommScope team got to work immediately with Authoring & Layout’s intuitive\ncontent blocks and templates. They have also extended their usage of Optimizely\nto create Virtual Selectors to simplify complex online solution configuring\nprocesses and create new content blocks including a 3D block that depicts\nlocations where CommScope’s solutions are deployed. Optimizely Content\nRecommendations’ Retargeting and AI-powered Web Content Recommendations worked\nin tandem to facilitate CommScope’s personalization efforts in delivering\ntailored content to different user groups. CommScope’s effort in non-stop\nenhancements for user experience meant continuous onboarding of internal\nstakeholders.

The business specializes in maintenance,\nrepair and operations (MRO) products and has SMEs to support customers from\nagriculture, food and beverages, manufacturing and grain who are undergoing MRO\nworks.\n\nAs the needs of customers are unique, IBT Industrial’s sales representatives are\nequipped with a broad knowledge of industrial products, from bearings to gears.\n\nFrom day one of this family-owned business, staying in tune with its customers’\nwants and needs has been the key to IBT Industrial’s success. One way it\nachieves this is by investing in its employees. With a three-year training\nprogram for new joiners and an average employee tenure of 15 years, IBT\nIndustrial employees build long-lasting relationships with customers by solving\nproblems with their deep understanding of industry needs.\n\n## **The changing needs of digital-first customers**\n\nAs its business grew, IBT Industrial invested in PunchOut and Electronic Data\nInterchange (EDI) for its procurement process to manage its non-exhaustive\ncatalog and provide convenience to customers. IBT Industrial wanted to make sure\nthat it was well-equipped for the newer, younger and more digitally savvy buyers\nthat were entering the industry.\n\nHowever, the IBT Industrial team soon realized that their digital channel had\nmuch room for improvement, as two in three customers interacting with IBT\nIndustrial were looking for ways to self-serve including retrieving invoices,\nbrowsing purchase history and more.\n\nDespite its relentless pursuit of meeting and going beyond customer\nexpectations, IBT Industrial did not have a digital channel and ecommerce\nsolution for engaging customers in mid-sized industrial distribution. This\nrevelation came four years ago in 2018.\n\nPaul Stubitsch, Chief Information Officer of IBT Industrial, shared that the\nteam spent nine months analyzing the industry, competitors and themselves to\ndetermine their next steps. The conclusion? Embarking on a digital\ntransformation journey was necessary for the business' survival.\n\nIBT Industrial knew it had to act fast to keep up with other industry leaders.\nIt needed a digital solution that would help to:\n\n- Convey IBT Industrial’s value to customers in an impactful manner\n- Simplify IBT Industrial’s complex offerings and services\n- Address the shift in demographics of customers and employees to a digital-first approach\n- Expand ways to communicate and engage with customers\n- Allow customers to self-serve on-the-go\n\n## \\*\\*IBT Industrial builds its ideal digital solution by listening to\n\ncustomers\\*\\*\n\nFor a business new to digital, IBT Industrial began digitizing its manual\ninternal processes including those related to freight, pricing, taxes and order\nfulfillments to be ready to support its organization-wide digital\ntransformation.\n\nOnce the team was ready, IBT Industrial kickstarted the platform selection\nprocess with eight companies. While there were a few solutions that caught the\neye of IBT Industrial, Optimizely was ultimately chosen for its specific\nmanufacturing and distribution focus within its B2B Commerce solution.\n\nOptimizely’s out-of-the-box solutions and integration capabilities with ERP\nsystems were appreciated by the IBT Industrial team, as they felt that the\nsolution understood their needs as distributors that deal with ERP systems\ndaily.\n\nIBT Industrial also identified Xngage as its Optimizely partner. The IBT\nIndustrial team shared that Xngage truly listened to them, are knowledgeable\nabout Optimizely’s solutions and how to best leverage the wide-ranging\ncapabilities to help the business meet its goals.\n\nWe’ve built a site for the needs of our customers. When I look at our\ncompetitors, I can see they’ve been on this journey a lot longer than we have\nbut we have plans in mind to better serve our customers. We might not be there\nyet, but we’re coming up quick.\n\nCarin Sampson\n\nVP of Human Resources & Marketing, IBT Industrial\n\nCarin Sampson, VP of Human Resources and Marketing, viewed Xngage as a strategic\npartner to the IBT Industrial business. She shared that the Xngage team was not\njust executing on the business’ vision, they were also providing IBT Industrial\nwith insights and useful suggestions to facilitate the digital transformation\nfit for mid-market B2B customers.\n\nBefore they got to work, the IBT Industrial team spent a good amount of time\ncollecting customer feedback and listening to customer expectations. This served\nas a digital transformation compass for IBT Industrial to deliver a digital\nexperience that would be on par with its renowned in-person experience.\n\nBy leveraging Optimizely’s Product Configuration capabilities geared towards B2B\nneeds, IBT Industrial’s new digital solution helps internal teams add and manage\nits extensive catalog in a simplified manner.\n\nIBT Industrial also successfully showcased its product information richness with\nlogical and robust content and visuals that provide their B2B customers with a\nconsumer-like shopping experience using the robust Catalog Management.\n\nIn addition, Optimizely’s intuitive product search helps both employees and\ncustomers locate products swiftly.

The AI-powered Search & Navigation predicts\ncustomers’ keyword search and displays relevant results for a frictionless\nsearch and shopping experience.\n\nOptimizely’s List Management capabilities also enabled IBT Industrial to\nfacilitate quick orders for regular customers. Customers can do so via their\norder history or uploading previous orders onto the platform.\n\nIBT Industrial accounted for questions customers may have about these new\ndigital processes and prepared useful tutorial videos and FAQs that address\nqueries clearly by leveraging the Content Management feature to create its\nKnowledge Center. The Knowledge Center also houses practical content including\nwebsite features, a user guide, site improvements and updates as well as a\nfeedback page.\n\nContent management is further leveraged to deliver exceptional content\nexperiences that help customers understand how IBT Industrial can help them go\nfurther in their industry. From industry news to IBT news, product comparison to\nhow-to guides, content is available for customers across the board.\n\nA large part of why customers choose IBT Industrial is its ability to source\ncustomized solutions and even reverse engineer parts that are no longer on the\nmarket.\n\nDespite moving to a more systemic solution to product management, IBT Industrial\nstays true to helping customers solve even the most customized problems by\nproviding a ‘Request Product’ form that allows customers to detail their\nspecific needs.\n\nOptimizely’s Analytics has helped IBT Industrial understand customers better\nthrough their purchases, browsing history and personas.\n\nWith a digital solution that was intuitive for tech-savvy customers while taking\ninto consideration new digital customers, IBT Industrial and Xngage built an\nindustry-leading platform that went beyond customer expectations.\n\n## **IBT Industrial’s digital transformation pays off**\n\nThe ease of searching for products on IBT Industrial’s new ecommerce platform\nhas increased online customers’ new products purchased by 20%. This behavior is\nexpected to persist, as customers can browse IBT Industrial’s catalog on the go\nas well as continuously engage digitally with the site.\n\nIBT Industrial’s intuitive website helps customers locate products swiftly, keep\nup with industry news, request specific products, and more B2B-targeted\nfunctionalities, IBT Industrial also experienced an increase in site traffic, a\ntestament to the success of its digital transformation.\n\nIn the first two weeks of the website’s launch, the number of site visitors from\nemail campaigns in the two weeks post-launch was equivalent to the total number\nof visitors from email campaigns in the previous year. This increase can be\nattributed to the rich product content that linked visitors seamlessly from\nemails to the website with clear visuals and key product information, resulting\nin an impressive 6,533% increase in site visitors from email campaigns.\n\nIBT Industrial’s new digital solution has also helped the team understand\ncustomers better by analyzing customer behavior and preferences. This has helped\nshape its development and marketing roadmaps, including content and search\nstrategies.\n\nWith many of its manual processes including content, order and product\nmanagement streamlined, IBT Industrial’s customers can self-serve, anytime,\nanywhere. The IBT Industrial team is also benefitting from this time-saving and\ncost-efficient approach, empowering them to focus on improving existing\nprocesses and experiences including strategic planning or account management.\n\n## \\*\\*IBT Industrial paves its way for a continuously customer-centric digital\n\nsolution\\*\\*\n\nThis is just the start of IBT Industrial’s digital transformation journey, and\nit has set its sights on bigger goals including leveraging personalization to\ndeliver targeted marketing.\n\nIBT Industrial also plans to constantly improve its digital experience to make\nit more helpful and supportive to reach out to new business customers while\nmaintaining the personalized relationship aspect for which the business is well-\nknown.\n\nThe team also plans to extend personalization into other aspects including\ntechnical-focused content delivery and quotations in the coming year.\n\nWhile IBT Industrial is off to a great start, the team believes they still have\nmuch more untapped potential in serving their B2B customers digitally compared\nto major industry players.

    "content": "# Laser Clinics creates vibrant customer experiences\n\nCombining the power of Optimizely's Digital Experience Platform and Microsoft\n365 to create a vibrant customer experience online and offline\n\n## A digital face lift\n\nCosmetic treatment industry leader, Laser Clinics operate 150 clinics across\nAustralia and New Zealand. Their franchise network offer services ranging from\nlaser hair removal and skin treatments to cosmetic injections. Since their\nlaunch in 2008, they have performed over 3 million treatments and have amassed\nover 1 million treatment users.\n\n**Treating the growing pains**\n\nAppealing mainly to the younger demographic, Laser Clinics wanted to maintain\ngrowth and increase customer satisfaction. They identified opportunities to\naccelerate market share, not only in its Australia hub, but in New Zealand and\nEurope. However, with the cosmetic treatment industry renowned for being\nextremely competitive, Laser Clinics found that without a digital proposition\nfor its primary audience, these plans along with their market position were at\nrisk.\n\nThere were multiple hurdles the team needed t new digital platform to overcome.\nWith hundreds of clinics operating off their own independent operations,\nobtaining a single customer view was a priority for the team.\n\nWith 4 main services, a major technical hurdle was easily managing online\nbookings when there were multiple options a booker may opt for. This was\ncompounded with obstacles such as, specific treatment room and equipment\navailability, predicted lengths of consultations, and availability of personnel.\nThis created numerous rules the cosmetic players had to overcome.\n\nOther challenges Laser Clinics needed to overcome prior to selecting a digital\nplatform included:\n\n- Buy-in from Laser Clinic board members for new platform investments\n- Reducing duplicate records from each clinic\n- Calculating average treatment times\n- Placement of online revenue collection & distribution\n\nLaser Clinics did not have the tools at hand to build a customer-centric digital\nexperience platform, nor to commercialise their services online. They consulted\nwith various stakeholders to understand not only their operational model better,\nbut also to understand the growing expectations of their young, digitally savvy\ncustomers. The team required a holistic approach to a new platform.\n\n## The ultimate customer journey on Optimizely + Microsoft Dynamics 365\n\nAfter developing a high-level roadmap alongside their 100 franchise partners,\nLaser Clinics opted for the combined power of Optimizely and Microsoft 365 to\nestablish themselves as leaders in the digital space. Evaluating multiple\nplatforms, Laser Clinics found that only this combination provided them the\npowerful, flexible, robust capabilities needed to achieve against their growth\nplans.\n\nThey leverage the Optimizely Commerce Cloud and Marketing Automation with\nMicrosoft Dynamics 365 as their CRM.\n\n## Elastic scalability that grows with demand\n\nAs Laser Clinics’ customer base grows in reach, so too does their Optimizely\ninfrastructure. Hyper-scale cloud infrastructure enables the digital platform to\ninstantly accommodate increased traffic demand. They leverage discounts,\ncampaigns, and promotions with no risk of downtime.\n\nFrom having all interactions in-clinic to now offering a digital service in less\nthan 6-months, Laser Clinics herald agility and flexibility as the key drivers.\nover digital as well as through their physical estate.\n\n## The digital and physical sync\n\nBookings through the Optimizely site account for 16% of all bookings. This means\nsubtle differences in-clinic such as the phone ringing less and more attentive\nstaff, resulting in a better physical environment for customers. Optimizely\nMarketing Automation helps quickly create campaigns across web, mobile, and\nemail. This automated flow has so far connected 900,000 customers with further\ninformation regards their treatment and other flash promotions. The Optimizely\nautomation syncs in effortlessly with Microsoft Dynamics 365 to give the one\ncustomer view Laser Clinics were eager to gain. Marketing Automation has helped\nboost conversion rates to 2.16%, higher than standard industry numbers. This is\nespecially useful for savvy customers who access the site 80% of the time\nthrough their mobile.\n\n## A holistic journey\n\nThe next steps include building on their European footprint in the UK. This will\nbe done through smart AI. An even deep look at their customer base will\nultimately gear them for further success as they mature digitally and enter the\ncapabilities of Optimizely personalization.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Campaign\n- Content Management System\n- Commerce Connect",

It owns and operates well-known theatres in the UK,\nUS, and Germany, and creates award-winning shows through its in-house production\ncompanies.\n\nATG’s industry-leading success can be attributed to its close working\nrelationship with top producers and creative talent, committed investment into\nits teams, and a customer-first approach to experiences.\n\nServing both sides of the market, ATG’s B2C customers consist of showgoers, and\nits B2B customers are producers and promoters of a wide array of live\nentertainment.\n\nBoth of ATG’s customer groups seek an exceptional digital user experience that\ncan drive excitement for shows and provide a seamless checkout process.\n\n## ATG improves its approach to digital product development\n\nBefore 2018, ATG’s digital function was outsourced to different vendors, leading\nto feature rollouts that were sporadic and lacked monitoring.\n\nDirector of Product at ATG, Stephen Taylor, shared that bringing the digital\nfunction in-house was the start of ATG’s digital transformation. The initial\nteam consisted of 12 engineers, one product manager, and one designer.\n\nAlthough the lean team started on a high note with great ideas, they needed a\ndigital solutions provider to help keep them on the right track of features\nmonitoring, hypotheses testing, and data analysis.\n\nThe digital team’s proposal to engage a technology solutions provider was\ninitially met with resistance as each feature rollout was producing results\nconsistently.\n\nHowever, they knew that various factors including performance an affiliate\nmarketing, traffic influx from new theatrical titles, and more could affect\nresults. The digital team wanted to identify the best practices for measuring\ntheir impact amongst the noise of a busy ecommerce platform.\n\nThe team knew they needed more than a digital solutions vendor. They needed a\nstrong partner to facilitate ATG’s journey to its ideal digital experience.\n\n## Putting customers first in ATG's experimentation approach\n\nATG found its answer in Optimizely.\n\nNot only did the ATG team receive mandatory training during the onboarding\nprocess, but Optimizely also acted as a partner that prioritized ATG’s growth.\n\nATG wasted no time in leveraging Optimizely’s **Feature Experimentation** to\nelevate the digital experience for its B2C customers, especially its core\nticketing journey.\n\nThe core ticketing journey makes up two-thirds of ATG’s experimentation efforts.\nThe most pressing issue was the significant drop-off rate during the seat\nselection process in the ticketing journey, which can reach as high as 82%.\n\nTo ensure controlled experiments, the Product Insight Manager of ATG, Monty\nMohamed, shared that Optimizely’s **Targeted Rollouts** function has helped the\nteam immensely, especially **Feature Flags**.\n\n**Feature Flags** enable ATG to canary test with quicker cycles in a real-world\nsetting without making disruptive code changes. ATG can also quickly roll back\ntests by a toggle of a button when it is set up with a Feature Flag, easing the\nwork of developers and engineers.\n\nQuote: ATG Quote Block\n\n## Use case 1: Optimising use of screen real estate\n\nATG identified its seat selection step as the key to its conversion conundrum.\nThe team hypothesised that if customers were given more screen real estate on\ntheir mobile devices to view seat maps, it would aid conversion rates. Monty and\nthe team put forth a feature flag that hid summary details before a seat\nselection was made. Upon choosing a seat, the hidden summary will show up at the\nbottom of the screen. This removes clutter from a small mobile device screen so\nthat customers can focus on the task at hand, selecting the best seats for their\nneeds. The experiment was a momentous win for the team, contributing to a\ndecrease in drop-off rates via mobile devices and increased overall checkout\nconversions.\n\n| **Variant A** | Variant B |\n| ------------- | --------- |\n\n|  \nAside from in-house experimentation requests, Stephen shared that ATG also\nreceives requests from its B2B customers to optimize B2C experiences for\nspecific processes.\n\n## Use case 2: Seat preview during seat selection\n\nTo truly deliver on the immersive musical promise of a high-profile West End\nshow, the Producer wanted to provide customers with a view from their seats to\nknow what they will be experiencing. As seats will have different viewing\nexperiences, ATG and the Producer worked closely to integrate this preview into\nthe seat selection process. The objective of this seat selection preview was to\nremove uncertainty from potential buyers and give customers as much information\nas possible about what they can anticipate when viewing the show.\n\nThe result of the experiment was a positive for both ATG and the Producer,\nincreasing revenue per visitor (the north-star metric) by 7% and conversion by\n6%.\n\n| **Variant A** | Variant B |\n| ------------- | --------- |\n\n|\n\n## ATG’s experimentation effort steals the show with proven conversions\n\nSince testing with Optimizely, the overall perception toward experimentation has\nshifted favourably at ATG. Stephen shared that the digital team’s impact can now\nbe presented clearly and credited to specific decisions that work towards\ngrowing ATG digitally. Monty also shared that the digital",

Stephen shared that the digital team’s impact can now\nbe presented clearly and credited to specific decisions that work towards\ngrowing ATG digitally. Monty also shared that the digital team’s proven work is\nmaking strides in building ATG’s experimentation culture. A growing number of\nATG employees are expressing interest and submitting test ideas, tasks he worked\nhard to get people on board with. ATG has also increased its experimentation\nvelocity to two experiments per week. The customer-centric approach taken by the\ndigital team with experimenting has also improved the overall customer\nexperience. ATG’s biggest experimentation win thus far was increasing seat\nselection rate by 10% and overall checkout conversion by over 2% via its\nexperiment showcased in Use Case 1. With Optimizely making up an integral part\nof ATG’s experimentation culture, Stephen shared that both he and the digital\nteam are encouraged to learn more and test faster to keep pace with Optimizely’s\ndevelopments.\n\n## ATG’s digital transformation has just begun\n\nATG is in the process of expanding its platform internationally with a 50%\nincrease in reach, traffic, and sales. With new markets, ATG is looking to tap\ninto new opportunities. The digital team will focus its resources on growing the\nbusiness digitally in both existing and new markets. Stephen shared that the\nteam is keen on increasing revenue per visitor. On a more granular level, Monty\nshared that testing efforts will be channelled to improving the UI of ATG’s\nplatforms, including displays of pricing, seat map, and more. The team will also\nincrease their testing velocity with Optimizely Web’s Visual Editor to empower\nmore non-technical ATG employees with easy-to-use tools to improve the\nexperimentation culture at ATG.\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n- Feature Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.atgtickets.com/",

Customers would go to the portal and abandon the site 80% of the\ntime. The system did not make sense to customers. They would sign up but never\nuse the site. It was focused from the inside-out. Instead, The Granite Group\nneeded a solution designed for the customer, from the outside-in.\n\nThe Granite Group wanted to provide a fully functional eCommerce experience with\nrobust cataloging, images and a solid taxonomy. They needed a solution that was\nintuitive, easy to use and provided the modern web interface their customers\nexpected. In addition, they required a platform that could scale and grow\nalongside the company.\n\nThe Granite Group did not want a static, cookie cutter website. They needed\nsomething that was capable of shifting with the needs of their industry. In\naddition, the solution needed to seamlessly integrate with their Infor SX.e ERP.\n\nWith goals to reduce the cost to serve existing customers, streamline processes,\nenable their sales team to be more efficient and grow revenue, The Granite Group\nselected Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud to power their new online experience.\n\nIt’s clear that [Optimizely] Optimizely is out there looking at what’s going on,\nlistening to customers and figuring out what to do next.

With [Optimizely] Optimizely\nB2B Commerce Cloud, we’re able to focus on what we do which is servicing our\ncustomers, while they take care of the rest.\n\nCoburn Flannery\n\nDirector of eBusiness, The Granite Group\n\n## A shift from full-service channels to self-service channels\n\nSince incorporating Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, The Granite Group has been\nanalyzing the shift from full-service channels to self-service channels. They\nhave seen an increase in online orders by more than 50% year-over-year and\nestimate that in 2020, eCommerce could account for up to 20% of their business.\n\nToday, sales associates are able to focus on adding value to their customers.\nThey have a lot of industry knowledge about the solutions The Granite Group\nprovides. Prior to incorporating Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, they were on the\nphone taking orders and completing other mundane tasks. Now the website is\navailable to customers 24/7 and the company is seeing a major channel shift.\nSales representatives are now freed up from simple tasks so they can focus on\nadding value in other areas and fostering deeper, more meaningful relationships.\n\nSuccess for The Granite Group means growing every year by adding employees,\nlocations, products and vendors.

Blue Apron also\nsells wine, which can be paired with its meals, as well as a curated selection\nof cooking tools, utensils, and pantry items, which are tested and recommended\nby Blue Apron’s culinary team.\n\nBlue Apron has developed an integrated ecosystem that employs technology and\nexpertise across many disciplines. The company’s supply-demand coordination\nactivities—demand planning, recipe creation, recipe merchandising, fulfillment\noperations, and marketing—drive its end-to-end value chain.\n\nWe can now get an early signal from the Optimizely Results Dashboard within a\nfew days, whereas before it would have taken weeks or longer for someone on our\nanalytics team to pull the data and understand what was going on.\n\nJohn Cline\n\nEngineering lead, Growth/Member Experience, Blue Apron\n\n## Getting started with experimentation\n\nSince their inception, Blue Apron has been a data-driven, customer-focused\norganization, and because the category of online food is growing and constantly\nevolving, experimentation is in the company’s DNA.\n\nIn the early days, Blue Apron used Optimizely Web for testing. It was easy for\nnon-technical users to create and launch experiments without engineering\nsupport, and the tool also worked well with their single-page application. But\nthere were some drawbacks. Optimizely Web only worked with client side changes\non the web, which limited Blue Apron’s ability to run experiments to optimize\ntheir mobile apps or back end applications.\n\n## Deciding with confidence\n\nJust when John and team were weighing options and solutions, Optimizely released\ntheir new offering, Optimizely Feature Experimentation. The solution targeted\nBlue Apron’s precise experimentation use case and provided mobile and server-\nside SDKs for testing within their code base.\n\nWith Optimizely Feature Experimentation, Blue Apron gets statistically valid\nexperimental results on their server and mobile applications which helps them\nmake faster, more informed business decisions. With Optimizely’s real-time\nresults, Blue Apron was able to avoid launching a redesigned reactivation flow,\nwhich would have resulted in a significant revenue loss.\n\nBlue Apron can now quickly and easily build and set up new tests that were\nsimply not possible before.\n\n## Reminding new users of upcoming deliveries: A hypothesis\n\nBecause of Blue Apron’s unique sourcing and fulfillment model, customers must\ndecide whether or not to receive an upcoming order shortly after their previous\nbox arrives. While this system works well for experienced customers, new users\noften require more hand-holding. They noticed that new customers were more\nlikely to miss their order management cutoff point in their second week. Blue\nApron hypothesized that customers that received these “surprise boxes” had\npoorer retention dynamics, and consequently poorer lifetime values than those\nwho avoided surprise boxes through proper subscription management.\n\nThey tested reminding new users that their cutoff was approaching, and\nencouraging them to manage their upcoming deliveries to see if it would decrease\nreported “surprise box” issues and improve the overall customer experience.\nAfter testing the email using Optimizely Feature Experimentation, they saw a 37%\nreduction in unexpected order reports from customers.\n\n## Scaling experimentation\n\nWith a consistent framework in place, the number of people at Blue Apron now\nperforming testing has expanded well past the Growth/Member Experience team.\nAnyone in the company on any team can create a test, see the results, analyze it\nand use that data to inform their decisions.\n\n_\"Now that we have this capability, other groups have started using it. We went\nfrom one or two teams doing one or two tests a quarter to now, when we probably\nhave at least 10 tests live at any given moment, and a large number of tests\nevery quarter being run by every product team.\"_ - John Cline\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Feature Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.blueapron.com/",

As a national\ncompetence institution with responsibility for outbreak investigation, infection\ndetection and counseling for the entire population, a number of occupational\ngroups, municipalities, as well as the government, comprehensive and ongoing\ninformation online is crucial and critical.\n\nWhen Covid19 broke out, the National Institute of Public Health's website\nsuddenly became one of Norway's most important sources of information.

During 48 hectic hours at the\nend of March, the entire organization's solution was migrated to Optimizely's\ncloud service, Optimizely Content Cloud. The platform came into place at the\nsame time as the national intervention came in full force - and very many have\nsought out and been dependent on finding infection control advice online.\n\n## Long-term benefits\n\nHaving all digital content on one platform safely managed in a simple and\nseamlessly scalable system - what Optimizely likes to call its customer-centric\ndigital experience platform - gives FHI many economies of scale.\n\nThe solution has several functions that are otherwise resource-intensive to keep\nprofessionally up to date on. The platform is delivered as a service where\nfunctions such as software, search, monitoring, security, scaling and operation\nare provided by experts.

This efficiency gain contributes directly to faster product and campaign launches, reinforcing Xerox’s commitment to innovation and agile market responses.\n- Streamlined Operations: Xerox employs 30 standardized execution and planning workflows and 13 work-request flows, serving four major lines of business. These flows integrate seamlessly into diverse marketing processes such as Advertising, social media, Events, and Product Marketing. This systemic organization ensures that all tasks are clear and manageable, enhancing the quality of content delivered to clients and ensuring alignment with strategic business goals.\n\n## **Background**\n\nWith a rich history spanning over 100 years, Xerox has continually redefined the\nworkplace experience by providing innovative technology that drives productivity\nfor its clients. Originally known for its leadership in office and production\nprint technology, Xerox has evolved into a comprehensive provider of software\nand services, catering to the needs of the hybrid workplace and providing\nclients with the solutions needed to navigate their ongoing digital\ntransformation. Embracing a client-centric approach, Xerox remains committed to\ninnovation, delivering digitally driven technology solutions to address the\ndemands of today's global and distributed workforce.\n\nFrom traditional office settings to industrial environments, Xerox offers a\ndiverse range of business and technology solutions, complemented by financial\nservices, to drive success for its clients. As Xerox continues its Reinvention,\nit builds on its solid core business with IT and Digital Services to drive\nclient and partner success. This expertise is also being used to create AI-\npowered solutions that enhance productivity, improve decision-making, and drive\ninnovation across industries to empower its clients and partners, ensuring that\nit remains a key player in fueling the workplaces of tomorrow.\n\nTo effectively communicate its transformed brand and array of offerings, Xerox\nrecognized the need for a robust digital platform capable of delivering\nengaging, relevant content to a global audience. The aim was to streamline\ncontent creation and management processes that involved multiple teams and\nstakeholders across different regions and languages.\n\nPreviously utilizing Optimizely’s cloud-based Content Management System (CMS)\nfor its SMART Centre sales enablement platform, Xerox was poised to elevate its\ncontent strategy. With an organization-wide emphasis on high-quality content\ncreation, enhanced content syndication, and improved workflow management, Xerox\nopted for Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform (CMP). This strategic choice\nprovided the robust, scalable solution needed to tackle Xerox’s complex content\nchallenges, ensuring consistent and impactful communication across all channels.\n\n**Xerox’ Journey with Optimizely's Orchestrate Platform: From CMS to CMP**\n\nXerox, a long-time partner of Optimizely, upgraded its SMART Centre website from\nan on-premises Ektron CMS to Optimizely's cloud-based solution in 2017. This\ntransition aimed to streamline operations and enhance user experience. The move\nled to reduced server costs, faster load times, and increased site availability.\nThe cloud-based platform also enabled greater functionality, transforming the\nwebsite into a dynamic platform with enhanced views and calls to action.\n\nIn 2019, Xerox embarked on a bigger and more ambitious transformation initiative\nin its global marketing operation with a focus on standardisation and utilising\ntechnology to help create more high-quality 'client centric' content and\neffectively get it into the hands of sales teams through digital first\nenablement platforms. As Rickin Hindocha, Content Operations & Technology\n(Global Marketing Services) at Xerox explained, Xerox faced the challenge of\ncentralizing marketing efforts from dispersed regional ownership whilst also\nconsolidating multiple agencies and establishing an in-house production hub to\nreduce costs across the entire global marketing operation.\n\nTo address this, Xerox integrated in-house and agency resources teams into its\nworkflow, which required a robust Content Marketing Platform (CMP). This\nplatform would streamline collaboration, communication, and workflow management\nacross teams globally.\n\nTo achieve seamless integration of in-house and external agency resources, Xerox\nrequired a robust Content Marketing Platform (CMP) that would enhance global\ncollaboration, communication, and workflow management. After a thorough\nevaluation, Xerox chose Optimizely's CMP (formerly NewsCred and Welcome) for its\ncomprehensive capabilities and potential for seamless integration with existing\ndigital tools. The decision was strongly supported by the solid relationship\nwith Optimizely’s senior leadership and the alignment of Optimizely’s global\npresence with Xerox’s corporate locations, ensuring effective implementation and\nongoing collaboration across teams. Xerox’ experience multitude of benefits with\nOptimizely's Content Marketing Platform**Xerox’ Experiences a Multitude of\nBenefits with Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform**\n\nSince implementing Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform, Xerox has realized\nsubstantial benefits across its global marketing operations. The platform's\ncentralization capability has transformed how teams collaborate and communicate,\nmoving from a fragmented system of ad hoc emails and workflows to a unified,\nefficient environment. This shift has greatly improved visibility and management\nof priorities, standardizing processes across the organization.\n\nThe user-friendly interface of the CMP enhances interaction, allowing for easy\nannotation and editing of assets.

The platform's\ncentralization capability has transformed how teams collaborate and communicate,\nmoving from a fragmented system of ad hoc emails and workflows to a unified,\nefficient environment. This shift has greatly improved visibility and management\nof priorities, standardizing processes across the organization.\n\nThe user-friendly interface of the CMP enhances interaction, allowing for easy\nannotation and editing of assets. This feature, coupled with the platform's\nscalability—supporting around 500 active users including Xerox’s internal and\nexternal teams—enables effective collaboration even among geographically\ndispersed teams.\n\nAdditionally, the platform has driven significant cost savings and operational\nefficiencies by centralizing content creation and asset management. This\nconsolidation has not only streamlined processes but also maximized the reuse of\nassets, leading to reduced content costs and a higher return on investment,\nhighlighting the platform's role in optimizing Xerox's marketing strategies.\n\nWe have over 500 active users in the system, ranging from stakeholders to\ncreators to approvers and activation platform owners. This encompasses all our\ncreative agencies and our Xerox’ in-house creative team, which is a key aspect\nof our content execution workflow. Optimizely’s CMP sits at the heart of our\ncollaboration, bridging the gap between teams in United States, Europe, Latin\nAmerica and India. It enables seamless interaction, brand governance and\nenhances our in-house process.\n\nRickin Hindocha\n\nContent Operations & Technology (Global Marketing Services)\n\n### **Use Case 1 – Work Requests**\n\nXerox utilizes Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform to seamlessly manage work\nrequests. Within its workflow system, they have meticulously organized 13\ndistinct work request flows, each tailored to specific teams within the company.\nThese teams cover a range of functions, from video production to digital\nmarketing, advertising and external agencies, as well as specialized areas like\nchannel partner marketing.\n\nThe intricate setup ensures that whenever a task is created—whether it's\ngenerating general content, launching an advertising campaign, or requesting an\nimage crop from an email automation service —the request is automatically routed\nto the appropriate team. This not only expedites the process but also ensures\nthat tasks are directed to individuals best equipped to handle them, optimizing\nefficiency and resource allocation.\n\n_Xerox's Task Workflows_\n\nPreviously, managing work requests was a fragmented and potentially chaotic\nprocess, often reliant on inefficient communication methods like email or\noutdated forms. By leveraging Optimizely's platform, Xerox has centralized and\nstreamlined their work request management, eliminating the need for cumbersome\nmanual interventions. This not only saves time but also enhances the overall\nquality and consistency of work output across different departments.\n\nFurthermore, the system provides transparency and accountability, as each\nrequest is tracked within the platform, allowing stakeholders to monitor\nprogress and ensure timely completion. Additionally, the platform's flexibility\nallows for customization of workflows to suit evolving needs, ensuring that\nXerox can adapt to changing priorities and requirements with ease.\n\n_Xerox's Work Requests Workflows_\n\n### **Use Case 2 – Campaigns**\n\nXerox employs Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform to manage their campaigns\neffectively, demonstrating a highly organized and streamlined approach. All\ncampaigns are meticulously organized within the CMP, providing a centralized hub\nfor all related activities. For instance, within a campaign titled \"Capture and\nContent,\" Xerox coordinates a myriad of activities, such as task creation,\npresentation updates, and event planning, with a total of 68 distinct activities\ncurrently underway.\n\nThis organization extends to asset management, as all created assets are neatly\nbundled under their respective campaigns. This ensures easy access and\nvisibility for team members, allowing them to track progress and access\nresources efficiently. The system's structured approach not only facilitates\ncurrent campaign management but also enables future endeavors. Team members can\nleverage past campaigns as templates, streamlining processes and reducing\nreliance on external agencies.\n\nA significant advantage of this system is the accessibility of source files.\nXerox has implemented a process where all source files, including videos,\nInDesign files, and PSD files, are uploaded and connected to their respective\ntasks. This eliminates the need to contact external agencies for file retrieval,\nsaving time and costs associated with such requests. Instead, Xerox’ in-house\ncreative teams can access and utilize these files directly, empowering them to\nmake necessary edits or reuse assets without additional expenses.\n\n_An example higlighting Xerox's 'Capture and Content Services' campaign_\n\n### **Use Case 3 – Approvals**\n\nXerox utilizes Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform to enforce robust\napproval processes, essential for centralizing content ownership and ensuring\nbrand integrity. Within the platform, strict approval workflows are in place,\nrequiring all content to pass through brand and client centricity checkpoints\nbefore release. This stringent system safeguards the strength of the Xerox\nbrand, as all content undergoes thorough brand reviews as an integral part of\nthe workflow.\n\n**Conclusion: Xerox and Optimizely’s CMP - A Core Platform for Content\nMarketing**\n\nXerox continues to use Optimizely's CMP as its core platform for content\nmarketing, and to leverage its features and functionalities to create and\ndeliver high-quality and high-impact content to its clients and prospects.\n\nXerox is also constantly exploring new ways to improve and enhance its content\nstrategy and execution, Xerox is strategically focused on integrating AI into\nits marketing operations over the next few years, establishing an AI council to\noversee this process.

Customers were able to purchase Laerdal's products on\nthe website in ten markets, but the solution consisted of a very basic product\ncatalog and shopping cart. Laerdal lacked the resources to present its content\nand products in a way that would help customers understand how the company and\nits products could help them reach their goals. Implementing a more advanced\ndigital strategy, with the infrastructure to support it, would improve Laerdal's\nability to communicate with its customers, improve the overall customer\nexperience, and offer a mobile-friendly experience for visitors coming from\nphone and tablet. With just two employees within the company able to edit and\nenhance the current site, Laerdal also sought to deploy a more user-friendly\nplatform that could be utilized by all team members.\n\nFinding a partner that you can trust is key, and we found that in Optimizely.\nThe new site is a big improvement for customer experience and the way Laerdal\ncommunicates.\n\nPål Oftedal\n\nDirector Marketing Communications, Laerdal Medical\n\n## A future-proofed solution\n\nAfter careful evaluation of both Optimizely and Sitecore solutions, Laerdal\ndetermined the Optimizely Digital Experience Platform would provide better value\nfor the price and was easier to use - one of the company's key requirements.\nWith more than 37,000 people in the Optimizely developer community, Laerdal also\nfelt confident it would have the resources necessary to reduce the risk of\nundertaking such a large project. The Optimizely Digital Experience Platform\nprovided the flexibility and scalability to grow with the business, accomodating\nboth current and future needs including a robust e-commerce platform, ability to\neasily expand into new markets, ease of use for editors, global capabilities and\nsupport, and the ability to easily integrate with existing business systems.\n\nThe project was split into two phases and rolled out across 29 websites with\ne-commerce in 18 international markets. The first phase addressed Laerdal's\ncontent needs using Optimizely Content Cloud. Phase two will include the\naddition of Optimizely Commerce.\n\nThe solution is hosted on Microsoft Azure and integrated with backend systems\nincluding an ERP, CRM system, and Eloqua marketing automation. Laerdal is also\nutilizing personalization on site. Eight different personas, including purchaser\n(e.g. hospital procurement department), trainers (looking for products to solve\ntheir needs in classes), and technical customers (needing to know how to set up\nand fix products), have been created with very different customer journeys\nenabled. The company hopes to further optimize the website with A/B testing and\npersonalization for first-time visitors vs. returning visitors in the near\nfuture.\n\n## Connecting customers with solutions\n\nImplementing the Optimizely Digital Experience Platform has helped Laerdal\nimprove its communication with customers. The new, more modern site employs a\ncompletely different look and feel, and puts connecting visitors with the right\nsolutions for their particular needs first and foremost. The website has been\nwell-received by customers, with Laerdal experiencing a 28% improvement in\nbounce rate since launch.\n\nSite editors have reported a much better experience using the new platform,\nciting Optimizely offers more opportunities to create better content and\ninteract with customers.\n\n\"With so many different stakeholders in a global organization, it's important to\nget everyone aligned internally before the project kicks off and to keep the\nlines of communication open throughout,\" says Pål Oftedal, Director Marketing\nCommunications at Laerdal Medical. \"Finding a partner that you can trust is key,\nand we found that in Optimizely.

The channel is known for its distinctive\nprogramming, which often pushes boundaries and tackles controversial topics.\nChannel 4 has been credited with launching several influential and ground-\nbreaking television shows and documentaries.\n\nCommercially funded, Channel 4 is owned by the Channel Four Television\nCorporation, a public body established by the British government.Channel 4’s\npopularity stretches beyond terrestrial television; the TV broadcaster also\nallows its viewers to watch its programmes online through its free video on-\ndemand service, stream through users’ SMART TV or watch via a dedicated mobile\napp. To improve the customer experience across its multiple channels, encourage\nusers to watch more content and test and validate experiments to maximize\nadvertisement revenue, Channel 4 partnered with Optimizely in 2017. **Lack of\nclarity leads to blockbuster change**\n\nInternally, Channel 4’s product management and experimentation teams walk a\ntricky tightrope. The teams must carefully innovate and optimize its on-demand\nplatform and apps to attract and engage users on a budget whilst ensuring that\nfeatures and changes that are made are released with minimal risk and disruption\nto both its users and advertising partners.As Andrew Jackson, Senior Product\nManager at Channel 4, detailed, “we wanted the opportunity to be able to try\ndifferent things cheaply, and ultimately reduce and minimize the risks of\nlaunching new features.” Before utilizing Optimizely’s Web and Feature\nExperimentation platforms, Channel 4 could lack clarity when testing new ideas.\nWhilst small group user testing provided some insight, the internal teams at\nChannel 4 lacked the ability to truly test and validate assumptions at scale.\n\nAlso, at the time, it was difficult to measure the impact of individual features\nand differentiate the impact of product changes from schedule changes. Laura\nShelton, Optimisation Manager at Channel 4, explained that “as a media company,\nyou can release features and try to measure the impact of them, but usage of our\nservices is influenced by which popular shows are on at any given time.”\nTherefore, Optimizely’s full experimentation suite, containing both Web\nExperimentation and Feature Experimentation products was selected by Channel 4\nto support the TV broadcaster with its A/B testing journey.\n\n## Behind the scenes of Channel 4's Web Experimentation strategy\n\nAfter a smooth onboarding process, Channel 4, supported by testing partner Good\nGrowth, quickly started to leverage Optimizely’s experimentation platforms to\ntest various hypotheses.\n\nWhen conducting tests, Channel 4’s internal teams work in multi-discipline\n‘squads’ who each own a particular strategy. To determine the focus and\ndirection of these squads, workshops are held over a two-week sprint period.\nData and insights from users, customer panels and competitive research are all\ncollected to shape ideas for testing. These insights are used to produce an\n‘Experiment Card’, which details the technical build of the experiment. The\nExperiment Card is then used by the delivery teams to build and quality\nassurance (QA) experiments, with the Experimentation team’s guidance on\ntargeting and segmentation. For experiments utilizing Optimizely’s Feature\nExperimentation platform, tests usually require a release via an app store\nbefore the experiment begins. Otherwise, all tests in general must avoid big\ncontent launches.Channel 4’s web testing partner, Good Growth, align with in-\nhouse developers to provide testing support on the website. They work closely\nwith Channel 4’s Experimentation team to ensure tests are run in a smooth and\nimpactful manner.**Channel 4 switches customer experience with Optimizely**\n\n**Use Case 1 – AutoPlay Experiment**\n\nOne goal of Channel 4’s on-demand platform is to engage its users and make it as\neasy as possible to watch content.\n\nChannel 4 hypothesised that reducing the length of time taken for content to\nautoplay into the next episode would keep viewers watching more content.\n\nThe team utilized Optimizely’s Feature Experimentation platform to run a feature\nvariable test that trialled various countdown timer lengths including some that\nthe business was nervous might be too short.\n\nThe test was a fantastic success, removing friction between episodes, and\ndelivering surprising results. The optimum countdown timer length between each\nepisode was shorter than expected, proving to be the ideal time to best engage\nviewers.\n\n**Use Case 2 – Picture in Picture Viewing**\n\nPicture in Picture (PiP) viewing is a feature that enables users to watch a\nvideo in a small floating window while using other applications or browsing the\nweb.\n\nAfter receiving consistent user reviews and feedback around the lack of PiP\nviewing, the Channel 4 product team wanted to incorporate the feature into its\nmobile app. However, there was concern both internally and from stakeholders\nthat advert breaks would be less impactful in a smaller viewport.\n\nTo test this, Channel 4 utilized Optimizely’s Feature Experimentation to run a\nfeature flag test to track and monitor when users were minimizing the screen and\nif these times coincided with ad breaks. The results of the experiment showed\nthat users minimized the screen at consistent intervals whilst viewing content,\nnot just whilst ad breaks were being screened.\n\nBy suggesting an experiment to explore the impact of PiP, Channel 4’s product\nteam were",

By utilizing\nOptimizely’s Stats Engine, Channel 4’s internal teams can quickly and\nefficiently monitor experiments while live. Laura Shelton noted that her team\nappreciated both the simplicity and accuracy of Optimizely’s platform whilst\nalso having the ability to dig deeper into the results and view convergence over\ntime before experiments reach statistical significance.\n\nThe increased flexibility that Channel 4 now have to run complex experiments,\ntrack events and define audiences has not gone unnoticed by those inside the\norganization. Laura Shelton commented that “because Optimizely’s web testing is\nso quick, easy and agile, we can at least explore ideas and see if it's then\nworth taking that forward into the more complicated areas to experiment on.”\nShelton shared that Optimizely’s platform allowed Channel 4 to launch features\nthat help to isolate changes and assign value to the change that was made. This\nalso allows Channel 4 to test in a more lightweight fashion as the isolated\nfeature can be changed, experimented on, and terminated if the experiment\nfails.utilizing Optimizely’s Web and Feature Experimentation products allows\nChannel 4 to quickly and effectively run both simple and complex experiments on\nits various platforms. The Events feature in Optimizely’s Web Experimentation\nproduct, which tracks the actions that users take on Channel 4’s website, has\ngiven the product team flexibility and leeway to run experiments when a variable\nhas been misinterpreted or implemented incorrectly.\n\nFrom a user management perspective, Channel 4’s internal teams found value from\nthe environment permissions feature. The feature controls which collaborators\nhave permission to start and stop experiments in an environment. This allowed\nChannel 4’s product team to limit the number of people who can change the\nstatuses of experiments or move them from one environment to another. This\nproved of particular importance for the development teams on full stack\nexperiments.Andrew Jackson explained that this feature helped to streamline and\nunderstand experiments that were taking place concurrently as, previously,\nexperiments would have to be duplicated across multiple projects.There has been\na culture shift and mindset change inside the organization towards\nexperimentation. Previously, features and releases would be guided by pre/post\nanalysis, sometimes supported with small user group research tasks. Now, there\nis a wider demand from senior leadership to product and marketing teams that\nensures hypotheses are validated and tested to mitigate risk, as well as prove\nimpact on KPIs and find the right direction to launch new features in.The number\nof experiments deployed by Channel 4 has grown rapidly with more than 150 A/B\ntests launched and documented in the past year. All experiments are now\ndocumented in a single repository. An experimentation community has been built\naround this repository, with comments and advice on experiments encouraged. This\ngives experimenters more feedback and thus opportunities to learn. It also gives\nothers the opportunity to learn at the periphery.ConclusionBy utilizing\nOptimizely’s experimentation platform and partnering with Good Growth to scale\ntheir A/B testing program, Channel 4 have realized the full potential that\nimplementing an extensive experimentation testing programme can bring to an\norganization. Now, hypotheses can be tested and ideas can be validated.\n\nGoing forward, Channel 4’s product team aims to hone its platforms’\npersonalization capabilities to create bespoke and tailored experiences for its\nusers.\n\n#### Industry\n\nMedia and entertainment\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Feature Experimentation\n- Web Experimentation",

    "content": "# Verivox sees 70% increase in cross sells through testing\n\n## Nimble, efficient optimization strategy helped increase cross-sells by 70%\n\nVerivox is Germany’s largest independent consumer portal for energy, and also\noffers online comparisons for telecommunications, insurance, and finance\nproducts. Their website allows visitors to compare rates among providers with\njust a few clicks and then quickly switch to the most suitable option. Verivox\nhas helped German consumers exchange more than 8 million contracts, saving them\nmore than one billion euros.\n\n## Optimization at Verivox\n\nVerivox’s primary revenue stream comes from commissions earned when customers\nclose a new contract. Thus, the company’s primary business goals are to get as\nmany of the visitors to their website as possible, and then to close new\ncontracts. Optimization helps them drive toward both of these key objectives.\n\nConversion Architect Frank Herberg has contributed to Verivox’s growth since\n2007 with his work in front-end development, usability testing, user experience,\nand now: optimization. A/B testing and optimization has been Frank’s primary\nfocus since 2013.\n\nFrank works with product managers across divisions to build the company’s\ntesting roadmap and optimization strategy, but he is also able to accomplish a\ngreat deal on his own. He regularly uses Optimizely to build and design smaller-\nscale experiments (such as landing page tests) on his own – even without a\nknowledge of HTML or CSS. Many of these tests have had a massively positive\nimpact on Verivox’s conversion goals.\n\nFor more complicated tests, Frank works in collaboration with the company’s IT\nteam and external service providers. With Optimizely, this collaboration is\nsimple and seamless – allowing Frank to grant the appropriate level of access\nand permission to each team member involved.\n\nIt’s surprising just how much can be achieved using Optimizely’s visual editor.\n\nFrank Herberg\n\nConversion Architect, Verivox, Verivox\n\n## Featured experiment: A 70% lift in cross-sells\n\nFrank recently optimized the \"Thank You\" page that appears after a new contract\nis closed. This step originally provided customers with a confirmation only, but\nFrank hypothesized that offering additional cross-sell options at this step\nwould further boost revenue per visitor. He tested several different designs and\nmessages for the cross-sell offer. Ultimately, the winning variation increased\ntotal cross-sells by 70%.\n\n### A focus on continous testing\n\nAt Verivox, optimization is an iterative process, where test results are\nconstantly used to draw up new hypotheses for the next round of experimentation.\nIn this way, the Verivox team is able to constantly improve their understanding\nof consumer behavior. As consumer needs and preferences change, Verivox is able\nto adapt in real time.\n\nContinuous, iterative testing is a crucial element of any successful\noptimization program.\n\n### Looking ahead\n\nVerivox chose to start small – with Frank spearheading the majority of testing\nefforts – but the program’s proven success quickly gained recognition across the\ncompany. After seeing such tremendous impact with limited resources, Verivox\nplans to spread optimization to more teams and departments across the\norganization in order to continue driving toward its key business objectives.\n\n#### Industry\n\nTech\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Web Experimentation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.verivox.de/",

This consisted of making it easier for wholesale\ncustomers to get what they need with less hassle, more convenience, and\nincreased self-sufficiency. While an existing system was in place, it was\nclunky, and adoption rates were low. Customers tended to go around the portal\nand call on Account Managers directly.\n\nAfter evaluating other platforms, Reyes Beverages Group chose Optimizely to\nsupport their ambitions; a faster, easier, and more efficient ordering process\nfor their customers - handing account managers more time to work their magic and\nless time administrating orders. The Optimizely Digital Experience Platform\nenables Reyes the ability to scale and support the marketing team through its\nease of use.\n\nRBG teamed with Optimizely Premium Partner Verndale, working seamlessly to\ntransform the existing, aging installation. The view was an updated, more\nrefreshing beerline.com system, providing customers with an advanced user\nexperience, and the most efficient means to create orders and monitor their\naccounts online.\n\nTo top it all off, Verndale integrated RBG’s back office systems directly into\nthe new system to enable more control over pricing and inventory, providing\n360-degree coverage on the backend ordering process.\n\nThe powerful capabilities of the Optimizely Digital Experience Platform have\nallowed Reyes customer network, of over 70,000 retail accounts, access to an\nadvance user experience, with the most efficient means to create orders and\nmonitor their accounts.\n\nDeploying Optimizely Commerce has led to an 18% increase in usership for the\nChicago based beverages distributor. This is complemented by a 28% increase in\nproduct pages views, indicating stronger than previous engagement and\ninteraction.\n\nShopping cart pageviews increased by 22% showing a trend towards visitors moving\nthrough the cart to convert at an improved rate. By deploying the Optimizely\nDigital Experiencej Platform, Reyes have encountered a 7% increase in internal\nsite search usage.\n\nReyes and Verndale worked in a co-development fashion to deliver an elevated\ndesign and user experience. The updated experience allows customers to find what\nthey need quicker and the ability to order fast.

All this while trying to stay ahead of customer’s\nneeds and presenting them with their orders before they know what they need is\nthe long-term vision.\n\nAnother area of future focus will be to expand its multilingual offering –\nadding an even more personalized experience to customers as they expand their\nterritories.

    "content": "# KappAhl converts physical customers to online shoppers\n\nOne of Scandinavia's leading fashion retailers build millions of digital\nconsumer connections on Optimizely\n\n## KappAhl as a brand\n\nKappAhl was founded in 1953, in Göteborg, Sweden, and is one of the leading\nfashion chains in the Nordic region. They operate 380 stores across five\ncountries and have a staff of approximately 4,000 employees in ten countries.\nTheir mission is to have value-for-money fashion to women in the prime of their\nlife, and also their family and all products are designed by their own designers\nand pattern constructors.\n\nKappAhl are a keen promotor of sustainability. Today, 58% of their products are\nlabeled as sustainable, and their goal is for 100% to be made of more\nsustainable materials by 2025.\n\nAll products are designed in-house and production at suppliers is carefully\nmonitored by KappAhl colleagues in in Turkey, India, China and Bangladesh to\nname a few.\n\n## Online shopping popularity\n\nOptimizely sat down with Maria Walmu, Online Manager at KappAhl to understand\nmore about the retail giant’s digital commerce ecosystem.\n\nMaria: ''I have worked within KappAhl since 2011. Actually, it was then that we\nstarted e-commerce for the Swedish market''.\n\nEven though KappAhl have a large physical estate, they are seeing an\naccelerating shift towards online transactions powered by Optimizely. Online\nactivity now represent 7% of turnover. ''It's increasing in share every year'',\nMaria mentions, marking a shift in consumer buying behavior for the retailer.\n\nMaria goes on to say KappAhl's target group is, ''women in the prime of life we\nsay, and their family. And since we have a very broad assortment, you can find\nfashion for all occasions at KappAhl''.\n\nQuote Block (New): New Block\n\nHaving such a broad appeal and consumer offering, COVID-19 presented a\nmonumental challenge to KappAhl. Maria shares that since the outbreak of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, a new segment of customers have found their way into the\ndigital store.\n\n''Not all customers who shop in our physical stores also shop in our digital\nstores, but the past weeks we have seen an increase in customers try out the\nonline channel'', says Maria.\n\nHaving both physical and online channels in sync is the progressive strategy\nKappAhl are employing. ''We do think that the online share will take a leap and\ngrow a lot...but of course, we are hoping that the physical stores recover more\nsoon, so that we can have a more stable situation. But we do believe that the\nonline share will be a lot higher even after the Corona situation''.\n\nBy analyzing available data, KappAhl are outsmarting the industry by\nunderstanding how to leverage different customer channels.\n\n## ''Everyone knows that you need to have an online shop''\n\nHaving a strong customer-centric appetite, KappAhl pay particular attention to\neach customer-journey in order to understand their needs in better detail. In\ndoing so, Maria comments, ''we're also seeing that the customer that is buying\nin both channels is shopping more frequently, with a higher average basket\nvalue. So it's very valuable for us to have a customer buying in both channels\nand not only one''.\n\nKappAhl utilise Optimizely Commerce to showcase their online offering. The\nOptimizely Commerce delivers modern eCommerce platform capabilities including\nProduct Catalog Management, Order Management, Promotions and Customer\nManagement. This is back-up with industry leading Experience Management A/B\ntesting features.\n\nMaria tells us, ''we have around 1-1.5 million visitors per week. And now,\nduring the Corona crisis, our conversion rates are much higher''.\n\n## ''We launched home delivery in a very short period of time''\n\nMaria talks of how KappAhl are marrying the two customers to complement one\nanother. They have introduced click-and-collect. ''That's been really successful\nfor us. Really connecting the digital to the physical. And here we have a\nstrategy that if you buy something online, you will have free shipping to all\nstores. And that is an incentive for the customers to go to the stores.''\n\nHome delivery was accelerated during COVID-19. Maria shares, ''home delivery is\nvery important, so that is something that we could do really fast. I would say\nnot all our competitors have home deliveries, so that's good that we managed to\noffer it as soon within the situation''.\n\n## Facilitating new ways of shopping: ''Personal shopping online, that's also\n\nbeen growing a lot''\n\nKappAhl are inventing new ways of engaging with consumers as they continue their\ncustomer-centric journey. Maria explains, ''one thing that we have and that\nwe're also promoting a lot right now is, that we help our customers to make\ntheir online purchases. If they're not familiar with shopping online, we can\neven buy all the products for them, and they only get an SMS. They get an SMS\nand then they will accept the payment, and the order is fulfilled in that way.\nAnd we're promoting that at the moment and we see that a lot of customer,\nreally, would like this kind of help''. KappAhl have created, ''a pop-up online\nthat if you need some help, we can chat with you and we can even place the order\nfor you''.\n\nThese gateways are some of the steps being taken that ultimately help the\nconsumer in their buying-journey and increases the likelihood of future repeat\npurchases.\n\nMaria shares, ''the conversion rate and the average buy is increasing more than",

The heart of the company lies in solutions that\noptimize the quality of life for the individual, their family and caregivers.\n\nEtac realized the strategic benefits of consolidating its entire business under\nthe same brand and creating “One Etac”: This results in a simpler way of\nworking, as well as clearer and easier communication both with customers and\ninternally.\n\nBuilding a strong shared digital presence was an integral part of this strategy.\nWith a complex internal setup and nine different market websites with country-\nspecific content, it was challenging for Etac to gather everything under the\nsame web solution at etac.com. It would also be exacting to complete the project\nwithin the specified time frame of two years. Organizational adaptations and\nsimplifications were initially required before the actual website could be\nbuilt.\n\nThe technical complexity posed another major challenge. There were different\nproduct portfolios, cultures and individuals to consider. All components had to\nbe put into place—basic technology, design and functionality.\n\n## **The solution**\n\nEtac chose to build its new website with Optimizely as a foundation, together\nwith InRiver PIM for managing product data—a particularly business-critical\nfunction, since Etac.com is a product-based site. Etac hired Consid, Gold\nPartner to Optimizely, to manage the project.\n\nEtac now has a unified digital presence and is able to offer a more user-\nfriendly website where it is easier to find products. Visitors and shoppers\nnotice the clarity and structure. The new website is also adapted for mobile,\nwhich makes it easy to search for products, etc. One measurable result is that\nweb traffic to Etac has also increased.\n\nVår nya sajt som samlar alla varumärken på en gemensam plattform är en\nstrategisk milstolpe i Etacs utveckling.

    "content": "# Helix Sleep drives more revenue by sending fewer emails\n\n## Thinking outside the box\n\nHelix Sleep is an ecommerce company that delivers made-to-order mattresses based\non the belief that sleep is a personal activity, and your bed should reflect\nthat. Though the bed-in-a-box is their hero product, Helix Sleep also sells\npillows, bases, bedding, and more to provide you with an uninterrupted night's\nsleep.\n\n\"The traditional mattress experience was awkward, and the showroom experience\nwas a bit unpleasant,\" said Laur Fiatoa, Senior Growth Marketing Manager at\nHelix Sleep.\n\n\"With the growth of online bed-in-a-box competitors, there are a lot of one-\nsize-fits-all models. However, at Helix Sleep we truly wanted to provide\neveryone with a different solution for their different sleep needs and create an\nindividualized, personalized solution for a universal problem,\" she said.\n\nThe problem for Helix Sleep was matching their personalized products to a\npersonalized digital experience. They were snoozing on the opportunity to match\ncustomers to a discovery process that helped them understand what Helix Sleep\ncould do for them.\n\n## Personalized marketing was just a dream\n\nAt Helix Sleep, Fiatoa had ambitious growth targets. To reach her goals, she\nknew she needed a way to ensure Helix Sleep provided customers with the best and\nmost personalized digital experience possible, all while progressing customers\ntowards purchase. She knew she had to find the perfect balance to accelerate the\ncustomer journey. The key to her strategy was using data to validate messages\nbut that required sending a lot of emails.\n\nOver-emailing was top of mind for Fiatoa.\n\nWhen Helix Sleep first started email marketing, they sorted customers into three\nprimary buckets: traditional prospects, those who took their sleep quiz and\nsaved their results, and customers.\n\nHowever, because these segmented lists were predetermined, it created a one-\ndimensional view of their customers and led to mass email sends with little-to-\nno message personalization.\n\nA widespread problem many marketers face occurs when curious shoppers show\ninterest in several products at once.\n\nFor Helix Sleep, this meant that there was also the potential that customers\ncould enter multiple different campaigns at once. As a result, the customer's\ncontent wouldn't reflect where they were in the customer journey or their true\ninterests.\n\nQuote Block (New): New Block\n\nEach product in the Helix catalog has a specific ideal buyer and different value\npropositions with corresponding SKUs (stock-keeping units). Again, Fiatoa wanted\nto create unique email sequences for each product line. Customers would get\ndifferent content depending on whether they were a better fit, say, for an eco-\nfriendly Birch Natural Mattress rather than the best-selling Helix LUXE\nMoonlight.\n\nFor Fiotoa, deciding to enroll customers in email sequences manually felt like\nguessing. That's where Optimizely Data Platform (ODP), part of Optimizely's\nmarket-leading Digital Experience Platform (DXP), comes in to help with data\nscience and behavioral targeting.\n\nLike Laur Fiotoa, marketers and merchandisers from over 9,000 brands trust\nOptimizely to power the digital experience with personalization at scale. To\nensure the right message finds the right customer at the right time, Data\nPlatform will harmonize data from across the digital ecosystem and create a\nunified view of the customer experience in a real-time profile. From there,\nbrands like Helix Sleep are empowered to act on customer behavior to deliver\noutsized outcomes.\n\n## Data Platform's harmonized data powers customer-centric campaigns\n\nFiatoa knew that when consumers make a more significant purchase like a\nmattress, there is often a long cycle of consideration and research before the\npurchase is made. People want to make sure that they get the right product, and\nthey can return to the website repeatedly for months at a time and engage with\nmany distinct products before making a final purchase.\n\nWith all that research, the need to know each shopper's entire digital footprint\nis paramount.\n\nFor Helix Sleep, 89% of their traffic came from anonymous shoppers, and 14%\nwould make multiple visits a month. With all of that complexity, how does one\nbegin to personalize when so much is unknown about the shopper, and conflicting\nsignals complicate understanding? Without knowing who the customer is, or what\nproduct interests them most\n\nWith identity resolution from Data Platform, brands and retailers can resolve\nunknown sessions into customer profiles and stitch previously anonymous activity\ninto verified records. Knowing the customer can mean the difference between a\nconversion and the competition.\n\nWithout an earlier conversion, such as submitting a form or a purchase, you may\nbe asking yourself, but how can brands take all that anonymous activity and\ncreate a relevant experience? That's where Data Platform has been a mighty help\nfor Helix Sleep.\n\n\"Now, we look at segmentation in a far more comprehensive way due to the\ntechnology and data capabilities that [Data Platform] provides,\" said Fiatoa.\n\nFiatoa's team can use priority groups in Data Platform to see prospects who take\nspecific actions and, as a result, qualify for multiple campaigns\nsimultaneously. Then, Helix Sleep can more accurately identify the most relevant\ncampaigns for individual customers via reporting in Data Platform.\n\nIn this way, Helix Sleep can use segments to engage with buyers. They're\nnurtured based on their level of intent and which products are most likely to be\nvalued based on their interactions with the brand and variety of products Helix\nSleep offers.\n\nFor example, if a buyer viewed the Helix Midnight product page but saved the\nHelix Dusk, that person probably has a higher intent for the latter product. At\nscale, events like these are analyzed by Data Platform's data science models.\nData Platform will train itself on your audience",

Every\ndata point captured means more accuracy for predictions and recommendations.\nThrough recommendations and segmentation, the Helix Sleep team can personalize\ndown to the individual for each campaign.\n\nBy using the more relevant priority groupings, Helix Sleep meets the customer\nwhere they are before the customer is even ready to convert. As a result, Helix\nSleep supplies the best possible marketing content — rather than blasting out\nthe same content to everyone.\n\nPreviously, Helix Sleep was only able to segment upon those who fell into one of\nthe three large buckets at one point or another and hope their email marketing\nwas accurate. Now, with Data Platform, the Helix Sleep team leverages data\nscience models to predict the best-next steps for each customer with the click\nof a mouse.\n\n## Results that help the Helix team sleep at night\n\nNot only did priority groups increase the conversion rate by 13%, but Helix\nSleep also saw a 16% increase in open rate and a 27% decrease in unsubscribes.\nIt may sound counterintuitive, but Helix Sleep is sending fewer emails while\ngetting better results due to targeting and personalization.\n\n\"When you're giving your customers the journey they're intending, they're more\nlikely to engage.

Henry promised that when it came to deadlines, quality, price and\nservice, he would always keep his word. He left a legacy built on trust.\n\n137 years and four generations later, Jones Healthcare Group has never wavered\nfrom Henry’s legacy. Though they’ve changed and transformed from an apothecary\npackaging provider to a fully integrated and award-winning provider of premier\npackaging and medication-dispensing solutions, over the years one thing has\nalways remained true: Jones sees the people behind the businesses they serve.\n\nTo thrive for more than a century, you have to innovate along the way. Today,\nJones serves more than 12,000 pharmacies across the world through its Healthcare\ndivision and is committed to not only providing outstanding service and end-to-\nend packaging solutions, but also simplifying the process. So when their\nhealthcare customers asked for more efficient ways to buy, Jones rose to the\nchallenge without hesitation.\n\nWe had talked to a lot of other providers that met some of our requirements. It\nseemed like they could maybe get where we needed them to be, but we didn’t\nreally have confidence. But with Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, the\nfunctionality we needed was all there. It wasn’t some customization we had to\nbuild. Our requirements were met right out of the box.\n\nJeffrey Runnalls\n\nDirector of Finance and Operations, Jones Healthcare\n\n## Serving customers well into the future\n\nThe medical manufacturing industry swiftly evolved overtime. As technology\nadvanced, Jones recognized a shift in their customers’ preferences. Jones knew\nthat in order to make their customers jobs easier, they needed to provide more\nefficient ways to manage the ordering process. So, they ventured into eCommerce\nto prepare their business for the future.\n\nIn order to validate their approach, Jones first conducted customer research to\ndetermine whether the need for a more robust online solution was something their\ncustomers would actually utilize.\n\nThe results of Jones’ survey proved the Jones team’s hypothesis right. Here are\nsome of the key highlights:\n\n- Jones customers were familiar with online ordering and conducted business online with other companies\n- 80.67% of customer respondents said they would find an online ordering system either very valuable or extremely valuable\n- Customers wanted eCommerce because they believed an online ordering system would be quicker, easier and available 24/7\n- Customers wanted features including real-time order/shipping status, tracking and re-order, eCatalogue – pictures, descriptions, customer specific pricing of all products, account and order history\n\nSo, Jones had their answer. Customers wanted eCommerce. They wanted a\nfrictionless order experience.\n\n## The hunt for the right eCommerce fit\n\nAfter establishing their goals, vision, strategy and team, Jones began their\nsearch for the right eCommerce engine to power the healthcare experience. Jones’\nkey eCommerce requirements included:\n\n- Account login/accessibility\n- Integration with their SAP ERP\n- Real-time order status/history\n- Reordering capabilities\n- Promotions capabilities\n- Frictionless checkout process\n- Unique user profiles\n- Catalog capability for generic, branded and custom SKUs\n\n## An emphasis on product content\n\nAs they journeyed through their transformation, Jones quickly realized their\nproduct portfolio was disorganized. It was hard to recognize part numbers and\nthere was no methodology for categorization. As part of the transformation to\nget their product catalog online, Jones had to organize their portfolio into\nproduct categories, details, groups and provide product images from multiple\nangles. This process proved to be a period of self-discovery. Now, the team has\na far better understanding of their entire product catalog because the project\nwent beyond eCommerce, driving a broader business discussion.\n\nThe Jones portfolio includes three kinds of products:\n\n- Generic, agnostic products, consumed by any pharmacy\n- Branded products that are tied to a specific pharmacy brand (equivalent to CVS or Walgreens)\n- Customized products for small pharmacies\n\nJones has anywhere from 600 (in-stock products) to up to 10,000 custom SKUs.\nOptimizely B2B Commerce Cloud was able to accommodate the complexities involved\nin multiple product types.\n\n## The new world with Optimizely\n\nBefore implementing Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud, the old buying process for\nJones looked something like this: _a customer would call and say, I’m Jim at\nJim’s pharmacy and I want my labels. That would form the PO._ Jones wanted to\nmove that conversation online. Today Jim can go login to his account, view his\ninformation, reorder and self-serve. Plus, in the previous model Jim would\nsimply have to trust that Jones knew what labels he needed. Today, as part of\nthe online solution, Jim can physically see his labels before he orders. Plus,\nJim only sees what he needs to see. He doesn’t get bombarded with products that\nare irrelevant to his business. The online solution is not only making customers\nmore efficient, it’s building confidence.\n\n_Optimizely helps Jones increase share of wallet._\n\nIn addition to building customer efficiency and confidence, eCommerce is helping\nJones increase their share of wallet by enabling the team to proactively cross-\nsell and upsell",

There are about 10,000 pharmacies across Canada\nand most of them carry Jones products. Jones already has solid market\npenetration.

Now\ncustomers are more aware of Jones’ entire product catalog and average order\nvalue is continually increasing.\n\n_Optimizely aids Jones with data hygiene._\n\nWhen customers register for the online solution, they must provide valid account\ninformation. The portal is helping Jones to gather customer information and\nimprove their data hygiene. Customers are opting in and giving Jones their\nconsent to send them marketing messages.\n\n**Jones hits year-one eCommerce goals one week after national launch**\n\nJust three months after their soft launch and one week after their national\nlaunch, Jones had already exceeded their year-one goals for eCommerce.\nOriginally, Jones set out to get 10% of their individual store orders online in\nyear one. One week after the national launch of their eCommerce platform, they\nhad already seen over 15% online. In addition, they aimed for 1,000 registered\nusers at the end of year one. One week after national launch, they had more than\n1,100 registered users.\n\nThough they’ve focused their eCommerce experience on individual stores (which\nmake up 40% of their customer base), Jones also sells through wholesalers. About\n60% of their business comes through large EDI orders from wholesalers. Early\nsuccess metrics have validated the importance and value of eCommerce for Jones’\ncustomers. The company has received nothing but positive feedback. Even\ncustomers who don’t place orders online have found value in simply browsing the\ncatalog and product information.\n\nBeyond the benefits at the individual store level, the online catalog has become\na system of reference for the wholesalers Jones serves. Wholesale part numbers\nare available and product data is plentiful.\n\nJones has been collecting customer feedback about the online solution. Here are\njust a few quotes from their customers about the experience:\n\n- “The Pharmacy Store has made ordering pharmacy supplies significantly easier for me and my team.”\n- “Items are easier to find and I like how the photos make is easy to identify products.”\n- “The ability to upload an order without having to search for items is a time-saving feature we’ve been using.”\n- “Favorites Lists make finding the products we need easy – without searching.”\n\nBecause Jones already achieved their goals for year one just one week after\nnational launch, the team is bringing their year two and three goals forward.\nInitially they aimed to have 25% of their individual store orders online. Given\ntheir success, they are marching toward 25% by year one and 35-40% by year two.\nThere are 10,000 pharmacies that use Jones products. What’s the endgame?

Steve Mosinski, Head of\nGlobal Marketing, joined the company after the initial implementation of\nOptimizely. He shared with us how data from Optimizely empowered Mosinski to\nmake impactful changes by organizing campaign schedules, perfecting send times,\nand A/B testing email content and design.\n\nBefore working with Optimizely, Fox Rent-A-Car used a siloed marketing\nautomation platform that lacked the customer context across Fox Rent-A-Car's\ndigital ecosystem. Furthermore, Fox Rent-A-Car's previous solution for email\ncampaigns lacked the segmentation capabilities needed to maintain a healthy\nsender reputation.\n\nWithout the customer context and the segmentation to target appropriately, many\nemails were deemed irrelevant to customers and routed to spam folders. As a\nresult, limitations in their technology stack were costing Fox Rent-A-Car big.\n\nAt Optimizely, we're on a mission to unlock digital potential. Our market-\nleading Digital Experience Platform (DXP) offers brands a composable marketing\ntechnology stack that empowers marketing leaders like Mosinski with control over\ntheir brand's customer data while providing the ease-of-use for confident\ncreation.\n\nAt the core of the DXP is Optimizely Data Platform (ODP), and for brands like\nFox Rent-A-Car, the keys to customer lifecycle marketing.\n\nSince launching advanced segmentation and automation with Optimizely Data\nPlatform (ODP), Fox Rent-A-Car has seen a 300% YoY increase in email revenue and\nsuccessfully restored its email deliverability.\n\n## Maintenance was overdue\n\nBy the time Fox Rent-A-Car began using Data Platform, they had emailed over a\nmillion people multiple times a week. As is too often the case for marketers\ntoday, it was challenging to identify bad email addresses and disengaged\ncustomers, which led to high hard bounce rates and a high percentage of spam\ntrap hits.\n\nUnsatisfactory deliverability, consequently, eroded their sender reputation. So,\nin October 2018, the team took a leap of faith. Fox Rent-A-Car decreased send\nvolumes (to as low as 200,000) to send in smaller batches and perfect\ndeliverability.\n\nThe team scrubbed their database to get rid of stale emails and began segmenting\ntheir customer base with Optimizely's data science algorithms to find insights\nhidden from within their customer data.\n\nThen, partnering with Optimizely, they watched deliverability improvement and\nstarted adding back contacts to the list every month.\n\nWe had tremendous success focusing on our customers in our emails and providing\nlogical actions within our email campaigns,\" says Mosinski, referring to their\nhighly relevant and beautifully designed emails. \"I love the flexibility of\n[Data Platform] and that it allows us to create these campaigns. And I love the\ninvestment our customer success manager has in our brand.\"\n\nSteve Mosinsk\n\nHead of Global Marketing, Fox Rent-A-Car\n\nAs a result, their sender reputation has been steadily improving, and they have\nreduced spam trap hits by 98% due to their list hygiene practices and\nOptimizely's segmentation capabilities.\n\n## Getting back on the road with winning campaigns\n\nMosinski's strategy to use Data Platform to segment his customer database paid\noff.\n\n\"We had tremendous success focusing on our customers in our emails and providing\nlogical actions within our email campaigns,\" says Mosinski, referring to their\nhighly relevant and beautifully designed emails.\n\n\"I love the flexibility of [Data Platform] and that it allows us to create these\ncampaigns. And I love the investment our customer success manager has in our\nbrand,\" he later added.\n\nCurrently, Mosinski is operating four major ongoing campaigns. He sends\nnewsletters with the week's specials and automated emails to follow up when they\nabandon a car reservation flow or browse without a significant event.\n\nEach automated email is personalized with content and offers suggested by Data\nPlatform to be statistically most likely to convert. The third campaign consists\nof extraordinarily successful location-specific post-purchase messages.\n\nPost-purchase emails use recipients' travel destinations to supply even more\npersonalization. For example, emails share fun information and blog posts about\nthe traveler's intended destinations.\n\nMosinski has shared that these campaigns generate an industry-leading average of\n32% open rate, 6% click rate, 21% conversion rate.\n\nWith fantastic metrics like that, it's no surprise that Mosinski loves starting\nhis day by looking at his campaign performance dashboards in the Data Platform.\n\n\"The analytics are available at once to me. Sometimes it's the first thing I\nlook at in the morning,\" said Mosinski.\n\n## Where do we go from here?\n\nMosinski and the Fox Rent-A-Car team are ahead of the game, and nothing stands\nin their way of delighting their customers. As of November 2019, the group runs\nan evergreen campaign that distributes information on products and services.\n\nThe emails go out every Tuesday and focus on one of the four topics of value,\nloyalty, geography, or vehicle fleet type. And as the market changes, the team\nwill adjust the topics of this flow to remain relevant to their customers.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Data Platform\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.foxrentacar.com/",

    "content": "# Brooks Running sees 80% decrease in return rate\n\n## Brooks Running decreases return rate\n\nFor retailers, optimization is not just about increasing conversion rate or\naverage order value; in fact, many retailers have realized that optimizing for\nmore than conversion rate and AOV are going to be critical to winning in\necommerce.\n\nTake Brooks Running for example. The running company recently examined purchase\npattern behavior of customers that returned merchandise and tested how to\nimprove customer satisfaction and revenue by anticipating and preventing shoe\nreturns.\n\nWhy focus on returns and not conversion rate? Because returns come at a cost — a\ncost of time, money, and opportunity for both the company and the customer.\n\nIt can take several weeks before the customer ships the return, Brooks\nreprocesses the SKUs and restocks the shelves. Furthermore, returning is bad for\nthe overall customer experience and an item returned means that other customers\nlooking to buy may get out of stock messaging when the item they wanted is\nworking its way through the exchange process. Nobody likes returns. Even if\nthey’re free, returns are a pain for customers and eat into margins for\nretailers.\n\nSo how do you create an experience that customers are satisfied with and are\nless likely to make a return? Brooks found that it’s a combination of\nunderstanding the unique consideration cycle for each product, tracking the\nright data and using Optimizely to provide a targeted experience to the right\ncustomer segment.\n\n### The hidden costs of big orders\n\nThe Brooks team started by looking into high-value orders. At a glance, high\naverage order value is a good thing and many retailers strive to increase this\nmetric. But a high value of the wrong products may be problematic.\n\nThe team saw a pattern in these big orders: many of them were for shoes of the\nsame model, just a half size or width apart. Examining the data, the team saw\nthat statistically, when someone buys two or more pairs of shoes within half a\nsize or width difference, at least one of those pairs will be returned. The\nshopper is actually searching for the best fit. In this case, high AOV is not a\ngood thing.\n\n> “A considerable number of our shoe purchases are for the same model, but\n> within a width or half size of each other,” said David Kornfield, Marketing\n> Manager overseeing optimization and analytics at Brooks Running. “With near\n> 100% certainty, we know one of those will be coming back.”\n> Knowing how costly returns are, the team focused on decreasing returns for these\n> orders.\n\n### Brining the real life experience online\n\nWhen considering the challenge to decrease return-rate among the segment of\nshoppers buying similar sizes of the same shoe, the team channeled the in-store\nexperience for inspiration. What do you do when you need help with sizing? You\nspeak to a sales associate. So they decided to bring the real life experience\nonline.\n\n_Brooks showed this pop-up message to shoppers who had 2 or more pairs of shoes\nin a cart that were half size apart._\n\nThe Brooks team used Optimizely to solve this challenge. They built an audience\nof shoppers who matched this criteria: 2 or more pairs of shoes in cart a half\nsize apart. They created a special pop-up message for this segment that read,\n‘Not sure what size to get? Our expert customer service can help you figure out\nthe one for you so you don't have to return one later. Call 1-800-2-BROOKS or\nchat with them now to get fitted.’\n\n### Results\n\nThe campaign performed incredibly well. For the test segment, return rate\ndeclined nearly 80%. Not only did Brooks have more product in stock, but\ncustomers appreciated the personal touch, with 88% saying they appreciated the\ncustomer service offer to help.\n\nConversion rate increased slightly by 2% which the team believes is due to less\nwebrooming—when shoppers look up products online, then choose to buy them in a\nphysical store—since the customer service reps were able to address size\nconcerns upfront. In line with their expectations, AOV decreased, yet add-on\nrate of ancillary products increased, perhaps due to purchasers not having to\nwait on return credit to complete their running gear collection.\n\nBrooks also measured the cost of customer service time — is having humans answer\nshoppers’ questions more expensive than the cost of returns? They found the\nanswer to be no. Customer service engagements averaged five minutes, which was\nless expensive than the hard costs of fulfillment and return shipping on every\nreturned order.\n\n“Rather than accepting our return rates as a constant, we were able to challenge\nthe widely accepted rate and reallocate the dollars budgeted towards returns to\nfund new programs and initiatives.” Kornfield added.\n\nAs a result of this campaign:\n\n- Customers are happy knowing that the Brooks team is there to help with customer service\n- Customers don’t need to spend time on returns\n- More product are available to sell to others\n\nFor Brooks, optimizing beyond the conversion rate means focusing on the customer\nexperience to protect the bottom line. It’s a shift from A/B testing to\npersonalized experiences for different customer segments.\n\n“After addressing basic site improvements, A/B Testing becomes less of a broad\nstroke tactic and more focused on user level and behavioral conditions,”\nKornfield said. “You need to dig into your performance data and address specific\nneeds of customer cohorts.”\n\n### Takeaways\n\n- Optimize for end-to-end experience, not just clicks\n- Identify a meaningful segment, understand their behavior by asking who are my customer segments? What are they trying to do? Where is the experience falling short?\n- Target a real-time intervention and as always, measure the impact\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail",

This extensive offering\nreflects the number of sites owned by Nykredit.\n\nAbout 4,000 staff members are servicing private customers and business owners.\n\nThe company’s digital transformation was driven by its desire to improve data-\ndriven personalization and increase integration into Salesforce and other\nindividual systems.\n\n2016 marked the start of Nykredit's digital transformation with Optimizely.\n\n## Lack of resources and prioritization hampered Nykredit's digital\n\ntransformation\n\nInitially, Nykredit’s CMS system and websites were managed by an internal team\nbut improvements took a backseat when their priority shifted to online banking,\nshared Thomas Frydensberg Christoffersen, a Senior Consultant at Nykredit.\n\nWith Nykredit’s business growing, it needed a streamlined method to create more\nbrand-compliant websites.\n\nSenior Digital Specialist of Nykredit, Christoffer Berg, shared that the team\nneeded a way to quickly replicate and reuse existing assets. To close this gap,\nthey visualized an internal Content Hub.\n\nAs Nykredit increased its self-service capabilities via online banking, it also\nincreased its use of forms for data collection.\n\nAllan Iskov-Eskebaek, Solution Architect at Nykredit, shared that the team could\nonly track simple conversions triggered by the form ‘Submit’ button. Allan\ndetailed that \"We couldn’t track our leads. Why did [prospects] go through the\nforms? Were they redirected from a third-party system, a commercial, or an email\nwe sent? When they filled in the form, did we close the sale immediately or did\nwe have to follow up?\"\n\nWithout a holistic view of the conversion funnel, they could not accurately\nidentify the source of leads.\n\nOn top of these issues, Nykredit also needed an updated homepage that reflected\nits identity as a leader in financial services.\n\nThe Nykredit team knew they needed a CMS that would help them close these\ndigital gaps and be future-ready to meet customers’ ever-evolving expectations.\n\n## Building a holistic view of content and customer profiles with Optimizely\n\nNykredit looked at available digital solutions providers and narrowed it down to\nOptimizely and Sitecore.Ultimately, Nykredit chose Optimizely for its ability to\nrealize Nykredit's Content Hub vision, a holistic database of its customers\nacross different websites to trace leads and understand users better.The\nNykredit team knew they needed dedicated resources for their digital\ntransformation goals. They decided to engage Immeo, an Optimizely partner, for\nImmeo’s reputable implementation experience with Optimizely.Berg shared that\nNykredit’s engagement with Immeo evolved from website development to site\narchitecture on Nykredit’s other subsidiaries. Immeo also worked closely with\nNykredit to maximize the use of Optimizely’s industry-leading capabilities.\nNykredit's relationship with Immeo is extremely strong. Christoffersen shared\nthat \"the Immeo team is great, and they have a strong background with\nOptimizely. Their Optimizely developers have helped us in many ways and they’re\nable to scale when we have larger-scale projects.\"Immeo’s flexibility in scaling\naccording to Nykredit’s project requirements also alleviated a lot of resourcing\nwoes.Optimizely’s headless CMS provided Nykredit and Immeo the ability to create\nopen APIs in various formats including JSON and XML easily to connect with\ndifferent apps and sites swiftly.

It\nheavily focuses on well-documented processes to deliver on its promise of\nsuperlative quality.\n\nThe leadership wanted to bring the same process-driven reliability and\nperformance to their marketing org. With a global blend of 8 marketers, 10+\noffice sites, and 4 product lines, collaboration and communication were\nparamount. However, with a number of point solutions and a mar-tech ecosystem\nthat wasn’t strategically integrated, the team faced a number of challenges as\nit related to visibility and collaboration.\n\n“The team as a whole had hit a roadblock. We were using multiple tools; each\nsolved a specific problem and had limited interaction with another. We resorted\nto an excel file to track campaigns at one place and soon enough, it had 8 tabs!\nIt took us up to 4 hours of meetings every week to align everyone,” said Patrick\nBark, Senior Marketing Coordinator at Safran. “We were at a critical point – but\nwe needed a better way”\n\nKnowing that the organization would need to streamline the way it planned,\ncreated, distributed, governed and measured all of its content, the team set out\nto implement a cutting-edge solution.\n\nMicrosoft Teams and SharePoint were sufficient for communication and storage\nrespectively, but we wanted to take it a step further and create a single source\nof truth. Project management tools like Trello posed security risks.\nOptimizely's CMP made it a breeze to involve all parties that needed to weigh in\non marketing decisions and get executive buy-in because they could see in real-\ntime what was happening in the team, and what would come after.\n\nPatrick Bark\n\nSr. Marketing Coordinator, Safran\n\n## Driving Visibility, Collaboration and Governance\n\nAt the end of 2020, the Safran team selected Optimizely's Content Marketing\nPlatform (CMP) to become a shared, centralized place for marketing planning and\ncollaboration.\n\nTheir objectives? Unify planning to provide visibility on a global scale,\naccelerate how teams create content and execute campaigns, and ensure governance\nand compliance.\n\n**1. Centralized Planning & Global Visibility**\n\nUnified planning allowed teams to guide organizational action from one place\nwith initiative-specific and intuitive workflows. From there, the global\ncalendar was automatically populated, providing visibility to other business\nunits, and enabling everyone to own their part in executing a plan.\n\n“It’s easier to get people on the same page when everything’s organized. If\nsomeone were to ask me what we are doing for customer experience, I’d simply\nfilter the results by the tags we are using. This kind of sort-by-variable\nfunctionality is great for analyzing results from different lenses and getting\nvisibility into multiple product lines,” said Bark.\n\n**2. Streamlined Execution & Seamless Collaboration **\n\nThe Content Marketing Platform's Campaigns module provided shared workspaces to\nnot only collaborate on the work but also to create custom templates for common\nworkflows to save time on future projects. It also made it easier than ever\nbefore to connect with professionals outside the niche one works in.\n\n“We standardized workflows across content formats. For example, we created a\ntemplate for tradeshows that allowed us to scale effectively. From budget\nplanning to shipping – we manage it all in the CMP“, said Bark. “This has\nallowed us to identify and fill gaps in our approval processes.”\n\n**3. Improved Governance and Verifiable Productivity**\n\nUsing Optimizely's CMP freed up time to focus on priority tasks and helped\nautomate routine actions. Various content optimization tools allowed subject\nmatter experts to collaborate in real-time and capture all feedback and action\nitems at one place.\n\n_\"We were spending a lot of time preparing for meetings to align everyone with\nwhat's happening. Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform eliminated the need to\ndo this. As an organization that is process-heavy, our quality team greatly\nappreciated the ability to track asset history and the ease of ensuring\ncompliance for each version.\"_\n\n_Patrick Bark, Sr. Marketing Coordinator at Safran_\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nOptimizely's Content Marketing Platform introduced a way to measure impact of\nmarketing initiatives at Safran while keeping everyone aligned. Standardizing\ncampaigns boosted productivity and made activations scalable.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\n“We’ve now launched a brand new website so our next steps include working on\nautomating and integrating the CMP into our web environment. SEO and marketing\nanalytics are the other side of the improvement coin for us in 2022. We are\nworking closely with Optimizely on UX improvements and feature requests to make\nit the one-stop-shop for all our marketing needs,” said Bark.\n\nThe full business impact of the CMP will be realized in due time at Safran;\nmeanwhile, feedback from champions like Patrick keeps the product ever-evolving\nto adapt to the needs of the modern marketer.\n\nWant to see yourself?

This made the choice of Episerver obvious, to ensure a faster return-\non-investment than other evaluated leading platforms.\n\nTogether with its partner, Vertic, ROCKWOOL GROUP set out to elevate their brand\npurpose, drive commercial excellence and deliver operational excellence through\nthe platform.\n\nBrand elevation would be achieved from discovering what ten different\nstakeholders looked to understand about the business, based on an ‘outside-in’\nperspective of what stakeholders cared about. Rather than the ‘inside-out’ focus\nof talking about products, ROCKWOOL GROUP devised a communication theme of\n‘Modern Living’, focused on discussing topics that aligned with stakeholder\nthemes of interest, such as fire safety, noise pollution and acoustics in\nschools.\n\n## Engagement through content\n\nEngaging audiences on these thought leadership pieces through the corporate site\nof ROCKWOOLGroup.com and their subsequent brand sites enables ROCKWOOL GROUP to\ncapture users at the beginning of their decision journeys, before maturing them\nthrough the appropriate product sites, each localized for market relevancy. This\nwas key to drive acquisitions through the sites and creating commercial\nexcellence across the organization.\n\nROCKWOOL GROUP take advantage of Optimizely Content Cloud by leveraging the\nVisitor Groups capability. This gave them the ability to display different\ncontent to users dynamically based on aspects such as location, type of content\nconsumed and visitor behaviour.\n\nConnecting the solution to Microsoft Dynamics CRM was a key aspect of measuring\nend-to-end commercial excellence success – what was the conversion from initial\nuser engagement through to lead acquisition, onwards to opportunity conversion,\nend sales and, ultimately, customer lifetime value.\n\nROCKWOOL GROUP is undertaking the final step of the plan, to achieve operational\nexcellence, through the integration of commerce platforms and selling direct to\ncustomers, whether those be consumers or businesses.\n\n## Creating the digital universe\n\nThe Optimizely platform for the .com acted as the ‘spine’ of ROCKWOOL GROUP’s\ndigital transformation, connecting the intelligence of all front-end\ninteractions with users to back-end systems. The new brand architecture through\nthe sites enabled ROCKWOOL GROUP to elevate its brand and conversations into\nbeing a thought leader. The new digital universe has accelerated ROCKWOOL’s\ncommercial excellence through three elements; digitizing customer service\nthrough chat bot and enabling scale, generate demand and leads through form\nsubmission, and enriching sales process with stakeholder insights and data.\n\nStakeholders are seeing that digital architecture has also enabled ROCKWOOL\nGROUP to seamlessly move prospects and customers across different digital\nproperties while ensuring a consistent, relevant experience. This provides a 360\nview of the customer that enables ROKCWOOL Group to build a more comprehensive\ndata driven profile for all customer segments, allowing easier maturation\nthroughout their journey. As the company evolves a direct commerce model with\nthe customer in the future, the website will evolve further to be a holistic\nend-to-end experience beyond just the pre-sale journey moment, recognizing\nprevious purchases and adapting experience dynamically to it.\n\nThe platform will be one of the most sophisticated created, with the opportunity\nto redefine the customer engagement model, drive business impact and create new\nopportunities to entangle with customers. With the new digital platform Modern\nliving and ROCKWOOL’s customers are brought even closer together.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.rockwool.com/",

    "content": "# Swinton Insurance merges 6 sites into one\n\nSwinton puts reactive content at the heart of their Digital Strategy\n\nSwinton Insurance is a UK insurance provider with over fifty years’ experience\nin the financial space. Having developed a strong market presence offering car,\nhome and commercial insurance on the high street, Swinton has evolved its\ndigital presence within the online insurance marketplace.\n\nGiven the complexities of regulation involved in the financial sector, building\nan effective online presence is no easy feat. As a result, Swinton had developed\na disjointed brand platform, spread across six individual websites based on\nservice offering. To address this, Swinton decided to simplify its approach,\npulling together all aspects of the brand into a single, transparent space –\nSwinton.co.uk.\n\nAt the heart of this digital transformation project was a commitment to develop\ngenuinely useful reactive content, including advice to warn customers of\npotential adverse weather conditions that could impact their insurance. This\ncontent would also be used to help guide customers through the insurance buying\ncycle. In supporting this task, the Optimizely Digital Experience platform was\nchosen to manage Swinton’s new, agile approach and to meet the demands of its\nmobile audience.\n\n## The Objectives\n\n- Make reactive digital content an essential part of Swinton’s wider content marketing strategy\n- Create a single web presence that supports customers on the go\n- Increase traffic to the Swinton website and keep them on-site for longer\n- Build relevancy for product-related pages in search engine results\n\n## The Solution\n\nHaving expanded its digital presence over the last ten years, Swinton was faced\nwith a disjointed brand platform spread across multiple websites. As part of a\nwider rebranding and transformation project, these six websites were merged\ntogether to form Swinton.co.uk – a reactive, mobile-responsive content hub based\non Optimizely CMS.\n\nLaunched in March 2014, the project took a content-led strategy, designed to\ndifferentiate Swinton within the crowded insurance space. By integrating a wide\nvariety of external data sources, Swinton developed a highly responsive platform\nfor every user.\n\nThis solution combines real-time data from the World Weather Online API, as well\nas keyword monitoring and social listening tools across relevant hashtags on\nboth Facebook and Twitter.\n\nBased on this information, Swinton’s digital content team can develop videos,\ninfographics and reactive guides to help customers protect themselves, their\nwebsites and their homes in the event of wet, icy and stormy weather conditions.\nFor example, the website can warn and assist customers one to two days before a\nsignificant or costly weather event helping customers avoid hazardous driving\nconditions and flood risks.\n\nThrough Optimizely Content Management System, this responsive content can be\nlaunched in real time for customers to browse and use while on the move. The\nsharable content generated is then used to provide additional social media\ncollateral, based on geo-targeted tweets and Facebook posts.\n\nSome tweets as examples:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SwintonGroup/status/735070160466350080\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SwintonGroup/status/711899831271346177\n\nExplaining this approach, Adam Moran, Senior Marketing Manager – Digital of\nSwinton, said, “We learn from data in surveys, social listening and the search\nterms used to determine the kind of content our customers are looking for. Then\nwe look to be critical about whether the content we create suits a real need or\npurpose.”\n\nCurrent content on the site includes everything from infographics explaining the\ndifference in cost between diesel and petrol, right through to videos telling\ncustomers how to weatherproof their homes.\n\n## The Results\n\nThe six Swinton websites were successfully merged together into a single,\nresponsive site, running on Optimizely Content Management System. This central\nplatform is now host to both proactive and reactive content, including personal\naccident advice, driver and buyer guides and embeddable infographics. The site\nalso hosts Swinton TV, a series of “How To” YouTube videos produced to help\ncustomers get the most from their existing insurance policies.\n\nUsing the integrated World Weather API, the new website has so far made use of\nover four million weather warning and reports, providing relevant and timely\ninformation to customers. Combined with Optimizely’s easy to update CMS, Swinton\nhas been able to flag weather warnings, develop instant help guides and launch\nthem on the website in as little as five hours - significantly quicker than the\noriginal target of one to two days.\n\nSocial media integration also allows this content to be shared beyond the\nSwinton site, using geo-targeted twitter campaigns to alert those in potentially\nhazardous areas.\n\nIn addition to this content-led approach, the new website continues to provide\ncustomers with the practical user interface and account management tools that\nhave come to define Swinton’s digital service approach.\n\n#### Industry\n\nFinancial services\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

    "content": "# Why TrustRadius runs 90+ experiments per year\n\n## Trusting experimentation to get it right\n\nTrustRadius is the fastest growing, most trusted customer voice and insights\nplatform that helps tech buyers make great decisions and helps technology\nvendors acquire and retain great customers. Each month, over 1 million B2B\ntechnology buyers use verified reviews and ratings on TrustRadius.com to make\ninformed purchasing decisions. Sitting behind this large audience is a hugely\ninnovative team made up of full stack engineers and product managers – all using\nexperimentation through Optimizely to make a huge impact on the TrustRadius user\nexperience for millions of users across the globe.\n\n\"When building products you don’t want to make expensive mistakes. Experiments\nhelp us stay user centered, mitigate risk, and increase adoption by\nincorporating user feedback early on.\"\n\n## Testing its way into testing\n\nTrustRadius literally tested its way into testing, just over two years ago. The\nsmart and agile team has placed experimentation at the centre of its ethos of\nbeing a customer-first platform, constantly looking for new ways to innovate and\nimprove. The TrustRadius team began their journey into experimentation using a\nfree solution, but soon outgrew it and started looking for one that would better\nserve its business needs. The team actually used the TrustRadius site to search\nfor the best user-rated experimentation platform – landing on Optimizely. The\nrest is history, with TrustRadius running 90 experiments, utilizing Optimizely’s\nfull platform including the Full Stack and Web products in the past year alone.\n\nTrustRadius has used experimentation to push the boundaries of what was possible\nwith the user experience. The team had a central focus on reaching 100 percent\nof its audience, ensuring its users find the right insights to make the best\ndecisions possible. This meant that community feedback from end users was\nintegral to TrustRadius creating the best possible user experience. It was\nimpossible to address feedback from millions on a 1:1 basis but, using\nOptimizely, the team was able to review metrics immediately reflecting the kinds\nof experiences users were having with each test. This meant user feedback could\nbe embedded into any stage of the product decision loop (idea, build, launch,\nlearn) and help the team improve decisions and steer clear of costly mistakes.\n\n## Ready, steady, experiment!\n\nTrustRadius started experimentation on one of its highest performing features,\nits TrustMaps. TrustMaps are charts that help users compare specific software\nproducts, based on real-time, end-user data. Due to these charts containing huge\nquantities of complex content, the pages that have TrustMaps took a longer than\nideal time to load and in turn, was disrupting the user experience.\n\nThe team knew they needed to fasten page load time, but were very conscious not\nto make changes that could be at the detriment of other functions on the page,\nas this could hinder user engagement as well. They set about trialling different\noptions of what could be shown on the TrustMap. Eventually finding that the best\nperforming option was the use of a static image on the main landing page, which\ncustomers could then click on, to gain access to the full TrustMap and its in\ndepth information. This meant users had faster access to the data that mattered\nto them, without waiting on a lot of unneeded data to load on the initial page.\n\nThe team saw a huge difference in results. The winning TrustMap variation had\nfour times the number of user interactions compared to the other variations the\nteam tested. Furthermore, the average page load time reduced by 0.2 seconds and\nthe exit rate also reduced by 3 percent. A win for all.\n\n## Calling out the call to actions\n\nOne of TrustRadius’ most successful experiments to date has been testing the\nlocation of its call to action (CTA) buttons on the site. They knew from survey\nresearch that half of software buyers consult vendors during their purchase\njourney, so based on that, they concluded that many buyers would want a vendor\ndemo. However, the CTA button that took customers to the demo was getting lost\nwhen users scrolled down the page.\n\nThe team thought that if they made it easier for buyers to find the demo CTA\nbutton, they’d get an increased click through rate and achieve a better user\nexperience. They ran an experiment to test this hypothesis. This involved\nchanging the location of the button, placing the call to action in a static,\nheader location. Based on initial results, the team experienced an incredible\n2xs increase in clicks, having made this move! With this clear evidence of\nsuccess, the team could then invest in making this a permanent location change\nfor that CTA button.\n\nAfter seeing such success with experimentation on the CTA button for vendor\ndemos, TrustRadius then conducted a similar experiment on the location of its\n‘claim link’ CTA button. After trialling different locations on the page, the\nteam managed to increase the weekly vendor profile claims more than 200 percent!\n\n## What's next\n\nWe plan to continue to use Optimizely to stay user-centered and make informed\nproduct decisions, and scale our experimentation program as our company and\naudience continues to grow.\n\nWe'll continue improving our platform's ability to connect millions of\nprofessionals with the right B2B technology answers, at the right time -and this\nwill require hundreds of new experiments across web and full stack, ranging in\ncomplexity from point mutations to validation of large roadmap initiatives.\n\nThe areas we're specifically experimenting with in the near-term are areas we\ncan help buyers more easily evaluate products using our platform. This means\ntesting into new kinds of content and data, provided in ways that are easy to\nnavigate and personalized to each buyer's specific use cases.\n\n#### Industry\n\nTech\n\n#### Product",

Revenue\nstreams and traditional business models, including international students, were\nimpacted, requiring many Australian universities to pivot their approach. Faced\nwith the reduced ability to reach students in-person, the need for digital\nsolutions became key.\n\nUniSA already had learned a lot from its previous online expos and from earlier\nOpen Days trials. In 2020, the university could clearly see students looking to\nengage in different ways and knew they could create a better customer\nexperience. In the past, the university experienced all the common problems,\nranging from mobile usability issues to device incompatibility. Collaboration\nsuch as Chat and Q&A functionality had limitations, and users weren’t\nautomatically directed to active live webinar sessions. Staff also spent a lot\nof time with very manual registration management processes and with reporting\nlimitations, such as not being able to follow-up with students adequately.\n\nGoing forward, UniSA’s students will expect a level of interactive engagement\nwhile researching their study options online, so this consolidated digital\nplatform will be of continuing importance in the future. It will form the basis\nof all future events such as the University’s Virtual Campus days, Virtual Fairs\nand year-round Careers Expos.\n\nMatthew Sayer\n\nCTO, Sudo Roux\n\n## UniSA uses Optimizely to create virtual open days to engage students\n\nThe University of South Australia (UniSA) is Australia’s University of\nEnterprise on the global stage, agile and astute, known for relevance, equity\nand excellence.

Undertaking research that is inspired by global challenges and\nopportunities, UniSA delivers economic and social benefits, and which in turn\ninforms teaching.\n\n## Creating a calendar of virtual events\n\nUniSA wanted to take a data driven approach to deliver an experience that would\nresonate with students. This included hosting a series of events across its\ncalendar. Events are integral to the prospective student recruitment process.\nThey have historically generated new sales leads and they allow the university\nto showcase its offerings and facilities, often providing a one-to-one\npersonalized approach.\n\nTo do this, UniSA needed a hybrid events platform that had the potential to\nscale across domestic, international and online students. Partnering with\ndigital consultancy Sudo Roux, UniSA deployed the Optimizely suite, which\ncomplemented its existing tech stack.\n\nUsing Optimizely’s CMS, Monetize, a solution was implemented fast - with\ndeployment in less than two months.

The brand and approach to the market is\ncentered around providing energy products that are easy to understand,\ncompetitively priced and backed by exemplary customer service. While the\nbusiness only launched a little over a year ago, the brand places emphasis of\nthe 186 years combined experience of its core personnel.**Focusing on growth**\n\nKeith Dezern, Vice President of Digital Strategy at OnPoint Energy, explained\nthat the initial focus throughout the first year of using Optimizely has been on\ngrowing the company’s B2C channel by a combination of acquisitions through\ndigital marketing, affiliates, and organic growth.\n\nHe explained they are simultaneously building out the tools and capacity to grow\ntheir B2B business, and this will take center stage in the company’s roadmap for 2024.**Using Optimizely to bring order to chaos**\n\nThe REP market has only existed since 1996, and history shows it has not always\nbeen easy for customers to use it to their advantage. Prices change at a\nmoment’s notice and customers find themselves on an energy rate that is\ngenuinely the best available one day and wholly uncompetitive the next. This\nsort of volatility can breed mistrust, and that mistrust is sometime well-\nearned, especially among newly launched REPs, in which fraud is commonplace.\n\nThis comes across as a risk, but it can also present an opportunity for a\nprovider to stand head and shoulders above the rest in terms of trust and\ntransparency. To do that with real meaning, OnPoint needed a platform that would\nallow deep insight into the enrolment and customer journey, but also and the\nflexibility and extensibility to allow for the integrations and workflows that\nare unique to the company’s vertical.\n\nOptimizely provides the means to deliver a modern, transparent and efficient\nconsumer buying experience for OnPoint’s customers. Keith confirmed that\nselecting Optimizely allowed OnPoint to enter the market without delay and ready\nto face the peak of market demand in Texas’s uncompromising summer months. 2022\nsaw the fourth hottest summer on record in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and power\nusage for home cooling was correspondingly high.\n\nInstalling the platform provided order management capability that incorporated\nfraud prevention, customer support, easier customer journey development and\nextensibility through API integrations. These included multiple integrations\nwith internal and partner platforms including vendor platforms for utility data\nmanagement and customer service. The platform also integrates with OnPoint’s\ncentralized repository of customer data that serves as our system of record for\nreporting, marketing and sales. **Immediate measurable results – fraud\nprevention and customer acquisition**\n\nOver the first week that OnPoint’s website was live on Optimizely Customized\nCommerce platform, the company saw an incredible 90% fraudulent enrolment rate.\nThis flood was stopped at the point of entry, so none of the fraudulent\napplications reached the point of actual enrolment as customers.\n\nOnPoint was able to use this information to create a fraud prevention process\nthat brought fraudulent accounts close to near zero in 90 days. This is an\nachievement that was unprecedented within the REP industry. It typically takes\nREP companies 12 months at a minimum to achieve meaningful fraud prevention.\n\nOptimizely has also enabled OnPoint to reduce customer acquisition cost to less\nthan half the expected cost to date. Optimizely’s Customized Commerce has lived\nup to its name, allowing OnPoint to work faster and smarter through third party\naffiliates, developing APIs that integrate with these third-party digital\nenrolment journeys.**Implementing Optimizely Data Platform (ODP)**\n\nOnPoint has implemented the first phase of the Optimizely Data Platform (ODP).\nThis phase set about integrating the customer data OnPoint held in Content Cloud\nand Customized Commerce, allowing them start using ODP for segmentation.\n\nThis served to drive marketing automation and analysis of OnPoint’s customer\nbook. The resulting insights from ODP have provided vital information to\nOnPoint’s customer support team, helping them to better understand what happens\nin the enrolment path from the customer’s perspective. OnPoint is confident that\nimproved brand engagement will play a critical role in reducing\nchurn.**Cooperation with BlueBolt**\n\nOnPoint set itself some stern challenges in getting to market against a tight\ntimeline in a market that has complex integrations and strict regulations.

Selecting Optimizely allowed them to leverage speedy market access at\nthe peak time in a difficult year. The platform provided everything the business\nneeded and more in terms of order management capability. This in turn enabled\nthe fraud prevention measures, customer support, and customer journey\ndevelopment capabilities we have already mentioned.\n\nKeith stressed that the team has found Optimizely easy to implement and\ncustomize and very price competitive relative to other platforms in the market.\nHe added that the capabilities across the Optimizely product suite give digital\nBusiness Development and marketing teams the tools they need to build a clear\ndigital roadmap that will empower growth.**Looking ahead**\n\nOnPoint is a company that is forever looking ahead in a fast-moving market.\nKeith commented that the business has successfully moved through what he calls\nthe “crawl/walk phase” of its year one digital roadmap, and that now it is ready\nto start running.\n\nThe next phase of ODP development is already planned and will focus heavily on\ngrowing the company’s B2B business. Phase Two will also include integrating\ncomplex utility data along with billing details and marketing interactions with\nGoogle and Meta. This step will have a significant impact on the business’s\nability to provide a truly personalized experience for customers, both in terms\nof initial enrolment and customer support.\n\nThis can only make sense for customers. Since deregulation, the world of power\nsupply has exhibited characteristics of the wild west on both the supply and\ndemand side of the coin. OnPoint is leading the way in cleaner and more\ntransparent processes that serve to benefit all parties. Optimizely is proud to\nhave the opportunity to be a part of this revolution.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Commerce Connect\n- Data Platform",

Content deployment times dropped to as little as 30 minutes, allowing the marketing team to respond quickly to market changes.\n- Improved Performance: The CMS’s integration with the Find add-on optimized page load times, particularly for product searches, enhancing the user experience.\n- Faster Experimentation: With the help of Stats Accelerator, GMHBA was able to run more efficient experiments, driving quicker insights and optimizations.\n\n## **Background: A not-for-profit with big ambitions**\n\nGMHBA is an Australian not for profit health insurance and care company\nsupporting more than 320,000 members on their healthcare journeys. They have\nserved the community since 1934, and with 90 years’ experience, have become\nAustralia’s leading regionally based not for profit private health insurer.\n\nThrough their personalised approach and exceptional customer service, GMHBA puts\nthe health and wellbeing of members and communities first. The approach is\nguided by their philosophy, Healthier Together and decisions are made with\nmembers first and foremost in mind.\n\nGMHBA manages two brands: the main GMHBA brand and Frank Health Insurance, which\ntargets younger, digitally savvy customers.\n\nTo better serve its customers and modernize its digital infrastructure, GMHBA\nturned to **Optimizely One** , a comprehensive digital experience platform that\nintegrates Optimizely’s Content Management System (CMS) and Web Experimentation\nplatforms to drive efficient content management and customer experience\noptimization.\n\nGMHBA’s journey with Optimizely began in 2018.**The Digital Challenge:\nModernizing a Complex Ecosystem**\n\nPrior to adopting Optimizely One, GMHBA’s digital operations were hampered by an\noutdated CMS, which limited its ability to manage content efficiently. The on-\npremise system required technical resources for even basic content updates,\ncausing delays and creating bottlenecks. The marketing team could not publish\ncontent without relying on the development team, slowing down time-to-market for\nnew campaigns. As a result, GMHBA sought a modern, scalable solution that would\nallow them to empower their marketing team and seamlessly integrate with their\nexisting systems while ensuring scalability and security.\n\nRecognizing the need for a powerful, interconnected platform, GMHBA adopted\n**Optimizely One**. This unified solution allowed GMHBA to not only manage\ncontent effectively but also create data-driven experiments to optimize customer\njourneys and improve the overall user experience.\n\nMoving to Optimizely’s cloud functionality has been a game-changer for us.\nDeployments are easier, and if our internal systems are down, Optimizely is\nstill up.\n\nCaghan Emirzade\n\nDigital Product Manager, GMHBA\n\n## **Implementation: A collaborative approach**\n\nThe implementation of Optimizely One in 2018 was a highly collaborative process.\nGMHBA worked closely with Capgemini, its chosen implementation partner, in a co-\ncreation model. Instead of a traditional hand-off model, GMHBA’s internal\ndevelopment team worked alongside Capgemini to build and integrate Optimizely\nCMS. This approach ensured GMHBA’s team gained the necessary expertise to\nmaintain and evolve the platform, setting the foundation for long-term success.\n\nGuy Moodie, Head of Digital Product at GMHBA, emphasized that co-creation was a\nkey success factor. By involving their internal teams early on, GMHBA ensured\nthey weren’t just adopting a new system—they were building the expertise to\nmanage it themselves. \"The collaboration allowed us to implement Optimizely in a\nway that was deeply aligned with our needs, ensuring our development team was\nfully capable of maintaining the system,\" said Guy Moodie.\n\nOptimizely CMS’s cloud-based infrastructure was a game-changer for GMHBA. By\nmoving from on-premise to the cloud, the organization gained reliability,\nscalability, and ease of deployment. As Guy Moodie noted, moving to the cloud\nmeant that even if internal systems experienced outages, Optimizely One remained\nonline, allowing the business to continue uninterrupted.\n\nOptimizely is more than just a CMS—it’s a digital experience platform. It’s the\nfoundational building block that allows us to deliver exceptional digital\nexperiences.\n\nGuy Moodie\n\nHead of Digital Product, GMHBA\n\n## **Empowering the Marketing Team: Efficiency and Agility**\n\nA primary goal for GMHBA in adopting Optimizely One was to empower the marketing\nteam to take full control of content management. Prior to Optimizely, the\nmarketing team relied heavily on technical resources to publish even basic\ncontent updates. Optimizely One’s intuitive CMS allowed the marketing team to\nmanage content independently, reducing bottlenecks and significantly increasing\noutput.\n\nGuy Moodie explained that this shift not only increased efficiency but also\nsaved resources. The ability for non-technical staff to manage content removed\nthe need for a dedicated content coordinator, allowing GMHBA to reallocate\nresources to higher-value activities. Additionally, the CMS’s multi-site\nmanagement capability allowed the team to manage both GMHBA and Frank Health\nInsurance through a single system, streamlining operations and improving overall\nefficiency.\n\nWith Optimizely’s CMS, GMHBA’s content throughput increased by 40-50%, and the\nmarketing team could now deploy content",

The time-to-market for campaigns improved\ndramatically, allowing the team to respond to market opportunities with speed\nand agility.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of the Find add-on has provided further\noperational benefits by significantly improving the performance of GMHBA’s\nwebsite. The add-on, used primarily for product searches and comparisons,\noptimized page load times, which enhanced the overall user experience. Faster\npage loads not only improved user satisfaction but also contributed to higher\nengagement, as customers could quickly and easily find the information they\nneeded, whether they were comparing insurance plans or exploring GMHBA’s\nhealthcare services.\n\nWe saved almost one full time employee by allowing the marketing team to publish\ncontent without relying on the digital team. Our content throughput increased by\n40-50%.\n\nCaghan Emirzade\n\nDigital Product Manager, GMHBA\n\n## **Web Experimentation: Building a culture of data-driven decisions**\n\nAlongside the CMS, Optimizely Web Experimentation capabilities enabled GMHBA to\ncreate a culture of continuous optimization and data-driven decision-making.\nWith Web Experimentation integrated into the Optimizely One platform, GMHBA have\nmoved beyond basic A/B testing to a more sophisticated approach to\nexperimentation. The ability to run experiments, gather insights, and iterate\nquickly has been central to GMHBA’s digital transformation.\n\nOptimizely One’s **Stats Accelerator** feature proved especially valuable for\nGMHBA, which does not have the high traffic volumes of a major retailer. Stats\nAccelerator intelligently reallocates traffic to the winning variation in an\nexperiment, allowing GMHBA to achieve results more quickly despite lower traffic\nlevels. \"For an organization like ours, Stats Accelerator has been invaluable,\"\nGuy Moodie shared. \"It speeds up the optimization process and helps us make\ninformed decisions faster.\"\n\nThe **Stats Engine** was another feature that helped GMHBA streamline its\nexperimentation efforts. It provided real-time feedback on experiment\nperformance and highlighted any issues, such as incorrect traffic allocation,\nensuring that the team could trust the data and focus on meaningful\noptimizations.\n\n## **Use Case 1 – Optimizing UX for landing pages**\n\nOne of GMHBA’s early and most impactful experiments using **Optimizely One**\ncentered on optimizing the user experience for its landing pages. The company’s\nhypothesis was that presenting too much information upfront in the top of the\nfunnel could overwhelm users and potentially hinder engagement.\n\nTo test this, GMHBA decided to experiment by simplifying the landing pages, .\nInstead, they deferred more granular content—such as coverage specifics and\nservice details—to later stages in the funnel, after users had shown initial\ninterest by engaging with the primary offerings.\n\nThe experiment ran for 100 days to ensure that sufficient data was collected\nacross all landing pages, given GMHBA’s relatively lower traffic volumes\ncompared to larger companies. Despite the extended run time, the results were\nclear: removing excessive information from the landing pages significantly\nboosted click-through rates. Users were more likely to continue through the\nfunnel when the information was presented in a digestible format, with detailed\ncontent provided when it was most relevant, later in their decision-making\nprocess.\n\nThis experiment not only validated GMHBA’s hypothesis but also played a crucial\nrole in shaping their broader optimization strategy. It highlighted the\nimportance of serving the right content at the right time to users. By adopting\nthis approach, GMHBA could ensure that customers remained engaged throughout\ntheir journey, increasing the likelihood of conversions. The insights gained\nfrom this test helped inform future optimization efforts, leading to a more\nstreamlined, user-friendly digital experience across the company’s web\nproperties.\n\nThe success of this experiment demonstrated the power of **Optimizely’s** Web\nExperimentation capabilities, enabling GMHBA to drive data-driven improvements\nthat significantly enhanced the overall user experience. The ability to\nefficiently run experiments and receive actionable insights allowed the digital\nteam to iterate and refine their strategy, setting the stage for continued\ndigital innovation.\n\n_Screenshot of old GMHBA landing page_\n\n_Screenshot of new GMHBA landing page_\n\nThe Stats Engine made us smarter. It eliminated a lot of noise from our tests\nand helped us rely on the data. Also, Stats Accelerator has been a godsend for\nus, especially given our lower traffic volumes. It helps us get results faster\nand optimize our customer experience.\n\nCaghan Emirzade\n\nDigital Product Manager, GMHBA\n\n## **Future Plans: Expanding the use of Optimizely One**\n\nLooking forward, GMHBA has ambitious plans to further leverage the capabilities\nof Optimizely One. A key focus over the next 12 to 18 months will be moving to\n**CMS 12** , which will provide enhanced functionality, including better\npersonalization and digital asset management. This upgrade will enable GMHBA to\nfurther streamline its content processes and deliver more personalized\nexperiences for both GMHBA and Frank Health Insurance customers.\n\nAdditionally, GMHBA is planning to continue its work on funnel optimization,\nusing Web Experimentation to refine both the acquisition and retention\nprocesses.

We believe it helps organizations to be more efficient and\nproductive.”\n\nThat’s the mission Sodexo employs across its portfolio of 100+ global services.\n\nAnd true to company form, Marianne Goguillon, SVP of Global Digital Marketing at\nSodexo, embraced that exact sentiment when evaluating the team’s martech stack.\n\n“We wanted to reimagine how we planned, created, and activated all of our\ndigital marketing assets,” said Goguillon. “And we needed to have a tool that\nmade the life of the team easier.”\n\nWith a large, matrixed organization of 90+ marketers covering 7 business units\nacross five countries (US, Canada, UK, Ireland, and France), collaboration and\ncommunication were paramount.\n\nUnfortunately, the generic project management tools they were using were not\nconducive to planning, producing, and storing the digital assets they needed to\nfuel their campaigns. They did not integrate well, created a lot of\ninefficiencies, and often slowed time-to-market.\n\nSo, the team set out to find a new solution — one that would become a\nfoundational piece of their martech stack, increase the capacity of their teams,\nand help drive efficiencies through the sharing of plans, resources, and assets.\n\nWe were relying heavily on the Microsoft stack, which is fine for project\nmanagement, but it required team members to go find the assets they needed,\ndownload them, publish them and so on... it was a manual, multi-step process and\nwe had a vision for something that made collaboration easy.\n\nMarianne Goguillon\n\nSVP of Digital Marketing, Sodexo\n\n## Content Marketing Platform: A New Solution\n\nIn early 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sodexo team selected\nOptimizely's Content Marketing Platform (CMP) to become a shared, centralized\nplace for marketing planning and collaboration.\n\nThe three main criteria: unify planning and provide visibility on a global\nscale, accelerate how teams create content and execute campaigns, and maximize\ncontent sharing and reuse.\n\n**1. Planning & Visibility **\n\nDedicated campaign workspaces allowed the teams to outline the plan and\ncollaboratively develop strategic briefs.\n\n“Now we have a forcing function and place for everyone to say, ‘Okay, what type\nof campaign are we running, what’s the goal, what do we need, and who is going\nto be involved’”, said Goguillon. “We’re consistently making sure nothing has\nbeen overlooked, or misunderstood.”\n\nFrom there, the global calendar was automatically populated, providing\nvisibility to the other business units, and enabling everyone to get to work on\ntheir part.\n\n**2. Production & Publishing**\n\nWith a high volume of content creators, the team utilized Optimizely's Content\nMarketing Platform’s powerful workflows and content editors to facilitate how\nthe creation, review, and approval process — and complimented it with\nsophisticated integrations to push the content to downstream channels.\n\nGoguillon and team recognized the importance of having a well connected martech\necosystem — there were a lot of efficiencies to be gained by eliminating a lot\nof the manual work they were forced to do previously.\n\n“Collaboration was happening back-and-forth in email. And we were manually\ndownloading and reuploading assets,” said Goguillon. “Now, we’re able to\nstreamline the process, and automate how we push that content to our CMS, Social\nchannels, and more.”\n\n**3. Storing & Sharing**\n\nThe CMP Library, a fully-integrated Digital Asset Management platform, helped\nthe team store, track, and repurpose all of the content they produce.\n\n“Whenever you change process, the natural reaction for many can be “what’s in it\nfor me?” — but this is where many of those folks had the light bulb moment,”\nsaid Marlow. “We made it so easy for them to see what pieces of content the\nother teams had produced, and in some cases, repurpose those assets for their\nown business unit.”\n\nThe net result? The Sodexo team can power the full, end-to-end lifecycle of\ntheir content production — in one tool.\n\n## Measurable Results\n\nQuite simply, the Sodexo team is delivering more — and enjoying the process\nalong the way.\n\n“Our capacity has shot up. We’re able to see more, produce more, and we have so\nmuch more content available to us stored in the shared Library,” said Marlow.\n“It has a compounding effect… Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform has turned\nus into a content and campaign machine.”\n\n\"Optimizely's Content Marketing Platform is a platform that has, simply, made\nour lives easier. We’re producing more than before, delivering campaigns, and\nseamlessly collaborating with all of our stakeholders.\"\n\nLiz Marlow, Global Project Manager at Sodexo\n\nIn addition to the visibility and production benefits, the team is also using\nthe platform to uncover insights and drive better programs.

With its\nheadquarters located in Stellenbosch, Western Cape employing 15,000 people,\nCapitec has rapidly emerged as one of the country's largest financial\ninstitutions. The bank was founded on the principles of simplicity,\naccessibility, and affordability, aiming to provide innovative banking solutions\nto the broader population. Today, Capitec offers a comprehensive suite of\nservices, including transactional accounts, savings accounts, personal loans,\ncredit cards, and insurance solutions to its 20 million clients.\n\nCapitec has garnered a reputation for its client-centric approach, utilizing\ntechnology to enhance convenience and accessibility for its clients. Serving\nnearly a third of the South African population, Capitec’s clients range from its\npredominant retail banking client base to small and medium-sized (SME) business\nbanking clients, as well as its digital banking users, with Capitec’s banking\napp the largest in South Africa based on monthly active users in the region.\n\nCapitec has achieved remarkable growth since its inception, enabling it to\nrapidly expand its client base and branch network throughout South Africa to\nchallenge the dominance of traditional banking institutions in the country. It\nhas received numerous accolades and industry recognition for its client service,\nfinancial stability, and technological advancements.\n\nCapitec’s journey with Optimizely and partner Responsive Digital began in 2018.\n**Problem**\n\nAs Suveshen Nadashen (Head of Product, Group Website (DXP)) explained, “before\nwe replatformed, it was extremely difficult to manage the website from a content\nand development perspective.” Capitec’s previous content management platform\ncaused its internal team several problems that prohibited the bank from creating\ncontent efficiently and delivering the world-class client experience that its\nclients expected from South Africa’s most popular bank.\n\nFirstly, the bank was experiencing frequent platform downtime due to\ninfrastructure instability. This resulted in the website being intermittently\nunavailable for clients, leading to a loss of trust. The bank’s existing\nplatform had reached its limitations and was becoming increasingly difficult and\nunstable to build on. This hindered the bank's ability to develop new features\nand limited its agility in executing marketing strategies.\n\nCapitec’s previous CMS had limited content management capabilities, requiring\ncode deployment for basic tasks such as adding a column to a table. This posed a\nsignificant constraint on the bank's agility and efficiency in content\nmanagement. In addition, the maintenance costs associated with the custom-made\nplatform were becoming prohibitively high. Capitec sought a more cost-effective\nsolution that would reduce the financial burden of ongoing maintenance while\nensuring a high level of performance.\n\nFurthermore, the previous platform provided limited data analytics and insights\ninto user behavior and navigation. This made it challenging for Capitec to gain\na comprehensive understanding of client interactions and optimize the user\nexperience.\n\nLastly, the on-premise hosting model of the previous platform required\nsignificant time and resources for server maintenance, software licenses,\nintegrations, backups, and hardware upgrades. This became an arduous and\nexpensive task for Capitec.\n\nCapitec selected Optimizely Content Managment System due to its ease-of-use,\nOptimizely’s technology roadmap and Capitec’s shared desire in building a long-\nterm partnership. The adoption of Optimizely's CMS addressed various pain points\nfor Capitec, including platform stability, content management limitations,\nmaintenance costs, digital transformation, data analytics, and hosting. By\nmaking this strategic shift to an enterprise level CMS platform, the bank aimed\nto enhance its digital capabilities, improve client experience, and drive\noperational efficiency.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nCapitec were not only looking for a world-class technological solution but also\na strategic partner to assist and enable its digital transformation. Responsive\nDigital partnered with Capitec in 2019 to deliver a robust implementation within\ntight timelines.\n\nResponsive and Capitec collaborated to enhance the client experience by\nleveraging future-proof technology. The partnership aimed to improve Capitec’s\ndigital maturity, enabling data-driven decision-making and achieving better\nresults from marketing campaigns. The ultimate goal was to increase conversions\nand enhance client experiences while also ensuring the bank remained competitive\nand sustainable in the long term.\n\nThrough their joint efforts, Responsive and Capitec successfully delivered an\nintuitive and well-built solution that improved service delivery, fostered brand\nloyalty, expanded client reach, and delighted clients.\n\n**Solution**\n\nCapitec has experienced significant benefits since implementing Optimizely's CMS\nand partnering with Responsive.\n\nThe bank has achieved remarkable platform uptime, maintaining nearly 100%\navailability since its inception.

    "content": "# Motoral supplies 12.5% of orders through recommendations\n\nA commerce platform designed for human engagement online through detailed\npersonalization. Finnish wholesaler use Optimizely to deliver a B2B portal with\nthe customer at heart\n\n## At a glance\n\n- 12.5% of orders supplied through recommendations\n- 25,000 product line items\n- 100M pricing combinations\n\nOne group to harness the power of artificial intelligence was the Finnish\nwholesale company, Motoral for which the benefits of AI have not been limited to\nits online B2B store, but have also improved the entire company's sales.\n\nMotoral, whose history dates back to the 1940s, has become one of Finland's most\nimportant players in the field of vehicular and transport-related products. The\ncorporation, which operates with a turnover of over €70 million, has found a new\ncompetitive advantage in an efficient online store and customer-specific\npersonalization enabled by Optimizely.\n\nThe online store, built on Optimizely’s Customer-Centric Digital Experience\nPlatform, was launched by Motoral in 2014. According to Motoral's development\nmanager Henri Ström, building a B2B online store is no easy task from the\nstandpoint of business operations and the requirements placed on the technology.\nIn a consumer web store, all customers are generally offered the same price,\nwhereas a wholesaler's pricing system is customer-specific, with many different\nlevels. It is particularly complicated at Motoral, whose selection includes up\nto 25,000 products. Motoral currently works with over 9,000 businesses, so the\nnumber of product-price combinations runs into the hundreds of millions.\n\n\"If you set out to do business on the web with a platform that isn't designed\nfor precisely this kind of use, you quickly end up with makeshift solutions that\nare less than ideal,\" Ström explains.\n\nAdding to the challenge is the diversity of Motoral's clientele, from major\nindustry players to small service stations and garages.\n\n\"Our range of products is broken up into catalogs appealing to the mentalities\nof different customers. What interested us about Optimizely from the beginning\nis that it makes the online store's content easy to personalize for different\nusers.\"\n\nEach of Motoral's customer groups has its own, personalized front page for the\nweb store. This makes the user experience more human and fulfiling. The view\nseen by a customer from a small garage, for example, will not include birch\nlogs, and sets of springs for heavy vehicles will not be marketed to service\nstations. With the current solution, Motoral is able not only to segment its\ncustomer groups efficiently, but also to engage in the customer-specific pricing\nthat is typical in B2B commerce.\n\n\"A mass of 100 million lines are updated in our system each night. Each customer\nsees the specific price that is right for him or her,\" Ström says.\n\nOptimizely Personalization began to produce results for us on the very first day\n\n- we immediately noticed that there was amazing potential here\n\nMotoral\n\nMotoral went to the next level in its online store, and began using Optimizely\nPersonalization, Optimizely's intelligent personalization suite of omnichannel\nsolutions for commerce, content and search personalization. The motivation for\nthis move was not merely an interest in the possibilities, but also a desire to\nfind products to offer their customers, out of a 25,000-product selection, in a\nmore efficient manner.\n\n\"Optimizely Personalization began to produce results for us on the very first\nday - we immediately noticed that there was amazing potential here,\" says Ström.\n\nAccording to Ström, Motoral has long placed a premium on knowing their\ncustomers.\n\n\"We know their addresses and phone numbers, and we can go and meet them at any\ntime. We see what they have bought from us, and our sales staff in the field\nknow them personally. Artificial intelligence has brought a great deal more to\nthe whole equation,\" Ström explains.\n\n\"Optimizely Personalization allows us to adopt an entirely different strategy in\nregards to what we offer the customer, and we are able to offer products much\nmore efficiently than we could before.\"\n\nAccording to Ström, one of the strategies entrusted to Optimizely was to offer\nproducts that a customer has not bought yet, but that are generally purchased in\nthe same orders as products that the customer normally buys.\n\n\"For example, earlier, we conducted email campaigns with promotions and offers\nthat I think were very well targeted and well thought out, but we discovered\ntime after time that even this did not work as well as expected. Now, we have\nmade email campaigns entirely automatic - we no longer product anything for them\nourselves. Optimizely has generated messages automatically, on the basis of the\nstrategies we have laid out.\"\n\nThe emails generated by Optimizely Email Recommendations, the email piece of the\nintelligent personalization suite from Optimizely, are now bringing up to four\ntimes more clicks to the online store than manually-composed messages. According\nto Ström, the potential power of AI-generated email campaigns is still largely\nuntapped.\n\n\"In other words, we know our customers, but at the same time we are not really\nacquainted with them. We clearly do not know exactly what will interest a\nspecific customer and when.\"\n\nIn particular, the right time for offering a product can be better determined\nthrough AI, according to Ström. This is valuable for Motoral given its large\nselection of products.\n\n\"The same space that was previously used for product recommendations is now put\nto more efficient use,\" Ström explains.\n\nAI and analytics forming an efficient whole\n\nAccording to Henri Ström, Optimizely differs from many other groups that",

In addition to AI, Optimizely customers get a skilled\nanalytics team and support to help them get the most out of customer data.\n\n\"Optimizely is not just a software vendor - they are also actively thinking\nabout how AI is utilized in business,\" Ström says.\n\n\"Optimizely's analytics team is able to respond to problems they are presented\nwith - for example, if we have a new brand and we want to know who it should be\nmarketed to. They are able to break down our customer data, buying behavior, and\npeople's activity at the online store, and send us guidelines on the basis of\nthis that tell us 'sell to these customers',\" Ström explains.\n\nOptimizely also offers Motoral an opportunity to support its sales team in an\nentirely new way. For example, the AI and analytics team now has the ability to\nhelp the sales staff by putting together targeted lists of products that\ndifferent customers might be interested in. In addition to the online store,\nthis also enables sales staff in the field to make contact with the right\ncustomers at the right time.\n\nThe use of AI is also visible in Motoral's online sales, where 12.5% of orders\nalready include products purchased on the basis of recommendation.\n\nHowever, a comprehensive analysis of sales numbers produced by Optimizely\nPersonalization is still in its early stages. Besides the online store,\ncustomers are able to order products from Motoral through 3-4 additional\nchannels, and this makes analysis of customer activity at the online store or in\nemail campaigns challenging. For example, an order may come to Motoral via field\nsales, even if an email sent through Optimizely Reach may have been in the\nbackground of that decision.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Commerce Connect\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.motoral.fi/",

With the same static pages being delivered to every visitor, the company\nwas losing users who expected a highly personalized and intuitive digital\nexperience.\n\nYamaha WaterCraft Group enlisted the help of Optimizely partner Whereoware to\nredesign their websites to be modern, personalized, user friendly, and\nultimately, capable of generating high-quality leads to local dealerships.\n\nOur products ignite a passion and a drive for amazing experiences in our\ncustomers, and we wanted our digital, mobile and web experience to exude that\nsame energy. Working with Whereoware and [Optimizely] Episerver allowed us to\ntap into the latest technology and development platforms, along with a world-\nclass design and UX team, to bring our products to life in way that replicates\nthe fun and excitement our customers have on the water.\n\nBryan Seti\n\nGeneral Manager, Yamaha’s Watercraft Group\n\n## The solution\n\nWith Optimizely’s automatic landing pages, both sites can easily attract long-\ntail organic search traffic, from otherwise highly competitive keywords, making\nit easier for potential buyers to find them. Since site launch, Yamaha\nWaveRunners has seen an 84% increase in site traffic, and Yamaha Boats saw a 92%\nincrease in site traffic. Once on site, visitors are now greeted with a modern\nand clean website that lets environmental and lifestyle imagery show off product\ndetails.\n\nWith a focus on the end consumer, Yamaha and Whereoware developed an interactive\nquiz on both homepages to help consumers decide on the best WaveRunner or Boat\nfor their interests, budget and lifestyle. They further this focus by\npersonalizing messaging, images and promotions throughout the website, based on\nuser behavior. If a website visitor fits the “21-foot boat persona”, the\nhomepage slider features a streaming video and environmental images of a 21-foot\nboat. As they scroll down the page, product images and text change to be more\nrelevant to a consumer shopping for a 21-foot boat. This persona-based\npersonalization continues throughout internal site pages.

However, the proportion of recipients who\ndo not interact with the mailings or send them unread to the wastepaper basket\nwas growing steadily. To turn these inactive recipients back into active\nopeners, QVC brought Optimizely's Business Consulting on board. The\ncollaboration was an obvious choice, as the company had already been using\nOptimizely Campaign for its email marketing for a long time.\n\nWith Optimizely Campaign, we were not only able to win back our inactive\nrecipients, we can now also write to them automatically at the right time. This\nallows us to create increased and qualitative customer loyalty in the long term.\nWe also benefit from the reduced time required thanks to automated campaign\nmanagement and extensive monitoring and analysis functions.\n\nTatjana Birmele Retention Marketing Specialist QVC\n\nRetention Marketing Specialist, QVC\n\n## The solution\n\nQVC planned a two-stage reactivation campaign with Optimizely in the period from\nJanuary to June 2020. The aim of the campaign was to encourage inactive\nrecipients to open QVC mailings again and interact with the content - without\nincentives such as vouchers or competitions.\n\nAt the start of the campaign on January 28, 2020, all recipients who had not\nopened any mailings from QVC in the last 90 days were initially recorded. They\ndid not receive any further newsletters for the next 14 days so that the\nrecipients' inboxes remained free of QVC newsletters for this period to allow\nmore exposure for the kick-off mailing. Only then did the reactivation start\nwith a kick-off mailing with the subject line “Do you want to open this mail...?\n😲”. The email itself contained an image personalization with the recipient's\nfirst name as well as missed offers, specials, sales and other benefits from\nwhich the user could benefit even without incentives. The highlight: a central\n“call-to-action” button led the recipient to the QVC Preference Center. There\nthey have the opportunity to adjust their profile data and select their\npreferred newsletter formats.\n\nIn the next step, a follow-up mailing was sent seven days later with identical\ncontent but the subject line “Do you know what we think about you?” to those\nrecipients who had not opened the initial mailing. The adapted subject line was\nintended to encourage recipients to open the mailing.\n\nAt the end of the campaign, all reactivated recipients, i.e. those who\ninteracted with one of the mailings by opening or clicking on it, were\ntransferred back to regular communication. They now receive the usual QVC\nnewsletters again. Recipients who are still inactive are automatically excluded\nfrom regular mailings.\n\nThe results of the campaign kick-off are impressive. 25.22 percent of the\npreviously inactive recipients were motivated to engage with the QVC mailings\nagain in this way. QVC also recorded an impressive click-to-open rate of 25.76\npercent and an unsubscribe rate of less than one percent.\n\n#### Industry\n\nConsumer goods\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Campaign",

The business currently employs\n3300 people and turns over around $1.7bn per year.\n\nSCA is the largest private forest owner in Europe, with around 2.7 million\nhectares of land in Northern Sweden and the Baltics. That equates to almost the\nsize of Belgium. Originally formed by the merging of around 10 different\nforestry companies, today’s SCA operates six distinct business lines (Forest,\nWood, Pulp, Containerboard, Renewable Energy and Logistics) that look very\ndifferent to 100 years ago but remain driven by the force of the\nforest.**Focusing on greater synergies and better communication**\n\nSCA’s long history, with a shifting of focus from traditional forestry and\ntimber production to a wider mix of sustainable products, including biofuels and\ngreen chemicals. The business has also set itself objectives to invest in wind\npower and to optimize production and processes.\n\nOptimizely has provided SCA with its content management solution for many years.\nThe partnership has been a fruitful and successful one, so SCA had no interest\nin changing provider. However, over time, SCA started to consider the benefits\nof switching from its on-premise system to a cloud-based-solution.\n\nSCA operates multiple websites. In addition to SCA.com, the platform hosts\nscasmarttimber.com, stiftelserna.com and skogsvinge.se. SCA was eager to\nconsolidate and align communication messages to capture synergies of scale and\ndeliver a consistent brand experience. It was also desirable to update the\ntechnical platform for a better editor experience. Upgrading the system would\nalso ensure compliance with the latest security and privacy best practices.\n\nThere were also several incumbent platforms with which the new solution would\nneed to integrate. These included SCA’s authentication platform, Cision, as well\nas Friendly Captcha, Piwik Pro and Imagevault.**Moving to a headless cloud\nsolution**\n\nAfter a consultation period in which SCA’s partner Comprend was instrumental,\nSCA decided that a cloud-based solution would be best equipped to help it meet\nthe medium and long-term objectives already outlined.\n\nMigrating from on-premises to a SaaS solution brings several instant benefits:\n\n- Reduced risk from a business interruption perspective – the consequences of fire, flood or earthquake are immediately reduced.\n- Always on the latest version – no more waiting around while the system updates or the latest security patch is installed. And no risk of missing out on better security or functionality by running an old version.\n- Real-time data backups mean better security and less time and hassle on manual backup processes.\n- Best possible security, even better than on-site.\n\nSCA also decided that a headless CMS would provide optimum flexibility. Put\nbriefly, a headless system is essentially a “back end only” repository of data.\nIt is suitable for businesses that use multiple channels and have legacy front\nend systems in place.\n\nIn the case of SCA, a headless CMS meant it was free to use React as its front-\nend framework for increased developer efficiency and navigation performance.\nThey can implement their design system as code and share this and other content\nacross multiple channels. SCA also felt that the headless solution delivers\nbetter separation of responsibilities between front-end and back-end developers.\nTemplating uses React framework code, there are separate repositories for\npresentation code and CMS code and at the front-end, developers can use content\nfetched directly from the DXP cloud.\n\nSCA’s Enterprise Architect Board did the final prototyping and approval, and\nmost content was re-published manually by content editors, while green field and\nproduct information was migrated automatically. Strategy architecture and\nanchoring within the organization took about five months, while building and\nlaunch took six months. The new system launched in January 2023.\n\nComprend, SCA’s implementation partners, were on hand to define the new\narchitecture for the transition from the existing on-premises software to the\nnew cloud solution and from head on to headless frontend architecture. They also\nworked on the communications strategy, including content workshops, message\nframework and structure, and the visual concept for the website.**Implementation\nof the new headless CMS**\n\nWith the new system, editors can continue to work with content in the same way\nas they did before. The mechanisms for display of public web pages are built\naround the Optimizely Content Delivery API, but with added optimizations, custom\ncontent filters and conversions to reduce the number of network requests and\nimprove page-load and navigation speed.\n\nAll the templates for public web pages are built in React and rendered on the\nserver side for the first page view and on the client side for subsequent page\nviews. The Microsoft ClearScript script engine, which is a .NET-based component,\nis used to render the page content of initial page views with React templates on\nthe server side. This avoids the need for a separate server environment for page\nrendering, which simplifies the hosting architecture and the deployment\nprocedures compared to some other common setups for websites",

This avoids the need for a separate server environment for page\nrendering, which simplifies the hosting architecture and the deployment\nprocedures compared to some other common setups for websites with headless CMS\nsolutions.\n\nThe websites can also be viewed in a purely headless mode, without any server-\nside rendering. This is particularly useful to front-end developers, who can use\ncontent from the DXP cloud while working on the React-based website\ntemplates.**Immediate benefits**\n\nThe new platform has been set up and designed with editors experience in mind,\nmaking their daily work easier. The privacy and security issues that were\nbeginning to cause concern with an older system have also been fully addressed\nby adopting an up-to-date cloud-based solution.\n\nAs far as measurable benefits are concerned, the previous start page scored 43\nfor speed in Google Lighthouse, and the new one scores 70. This represents a\nsignificant improvement and is an impressive result for a website that has been\nbuilt with design and profiling considerations ahead of speed. It is not just\nthe start page that has improved. Other pages have benefited from similar speed\nimprovements, increasing from 60 to 64 and 75 to 83. It is also worth noting\nthat the headless architecture with a single-page-application concept improves\nthe perceived speed of internal navigation within any of the websites on the web\nplatform. This is particularly noticeable on mobile devices such as smartphones,\nwhich tend to be relatively slow.\n\nThe new platform has also delivered cost savings. The overall platform is more\ncost efficient in terms of direct cost. In addition, SCA's team has reaped the\nbenefits of internal value creation, as the IT team does not need to focus on\ninternal operations of the website.**Building on a successful relationship**\n\nOptimizely is proud to have worked alongside both SCA and Comprend for several\nyears. When the time came to replace the legacy system, Optimizely and SCA were\nable to build on the existing relationship and build a solution that delivered\nmeasurable immediate benefits.\n\nOptimizely's CMS now puts SCA in the best possible position to meet its\nstrategic objectives in challenging times as a key player in an industry that is\nundergoing rapid change and evolution.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Content Management System",

With strong\ngrowth over the last 25 years, the chain operates 31 physical storefronts\nconcentrated across 5 US States and a digital footprint spanning North America.\n\nMurdoch’s had become all too familiar with inventory gaps between their digital\ncommerce warehouse and physical stores. Hundreds of assortments on Murdochs.com\nlacked size and color variations, and Murdoch’s were unable to offer their\nentire product catalog online. The retailer needed to kit themselves with a\ndigital landscape that included features relative to their cause - such as buy-\nonline and ship-from-store to drive sales. Murdoch’s also recognized industry\ntrends and the migration towards more cloud-based technologies to support\ndigital commerce. As a result, Murdoch’s sought a more complete Content &\nCommerce solution that could be managed and maintained in the cloud.\n\n**Measures for Success**\n\n- Build a strong relationship to create and execute a long-term, futureproofed delivery model\n- Focus on continuous growth, by making incremental improvements to digital environment to increase KPI’s\n- Enable modern digital commerce retail features like buy-online and shop-from-store\n- Implement a Cloud solution that will enable the business to take advantage of the latest retail features to meet the needs of customers\n- End experience - better serve the buying habits and needs of the customer base and offer the entire product catalog across all regions of retail footprint\n\n## Solution\n\nMurdoch's Home and Ranch upgraded from Ektron to the Optimizely Digital\nExperience Platform.

Sophie Schwartz of Mayrand, talks\nabout the various challenges she experiences in the ecommerce bulk grocery space\n\n## Mayrand revolutionise grocery market in Canada\n\nMayrand Food Depot is a Quebec food trade specialist since 1914 offering the\nwidest assortment of food, kitchen items and packaging all under one roof.\nMayrand specialize in bulk grocery and continue to serve B2B professions of the\nfood industry such as: Catering services & Restaurants, Day Care, Coffee and\nsandwich shop, Pizzeria, Dairy bar, Chocolate makers as well as B2C to\nindividuals.\n\nThe food wholesaler had no online ecommerce presence to serve their growing\ncustomer base. They wanted to put this into place quickly to better serve their\ncustomers with several objectives in mind:\n\n- Grow market share by showcasing Mayrand business key differentiators\n- Simplify client experience for purchases\n- Increase digital presence and attract new B2B clients\n- Accelerate checkout flow\n- Re-use the platform with sister companies\n\nHaving experience from other platforms, Mayrand was looking for a complete\nplatform that would have easy to use CMS & Marketing features as well as\nintegrated ecommerce functionalities all while maintaining top performance. For\nthese reasons, the Optimizely Digital Experience Cloud was selected to build\ntheir new ecommerce platform in order to deliver and exceed consumer experience\nonline and in-store.\n\n## The Ingredients to a Commerce Experience Accessible to All\n\n- **Accelerate growth** - accelerate Mayrand Food Depot’s growth by highlighting the brand differentiators\n- **Accommodate to new, modern consumers** – acquire a new type of modern grocery shoppers (mobile, quick)\n- **Simplify client experience for purchases** - especially in the case of B2B where they already know their sku’s and want to order large quantities quickly or repeat orders\n- **Strengthen in-store traffic** – reinforce and motivate drive to store traffic\n- **Increase digital presence** - reinforce the brand and attract new B2B clients\n- **Futureproof digital solution** - build the foundation for a long-term digital solution for multiple locations and banners in the company group\n\n## The Menu of Requirements\n\nMayrand required a platform with strong content management features for easy\nauthoring and quick content modifications. In addition, the Canadian wholesaler\nrequired a powerful, flexible and robust ecommerce engine for their tens of\nthousands of sku’s and future store expansions plan with multi-site inventories\nand other companies in their banner.\n\nWith that, they would need the latest marketing features to personalize their\nB2B content to specific consumer markets.\n\nAfter evaluating other platforms, Mayrand chose Optimizelyl Commerce Cloud,\nbuilt on Microsoft Azure, to fulfil all their requirements. Coupling its\nmultiple transactional features, including inventory management, with\nOptimizely's best-in-class Content Cloud hands Mayrand the power of content and\necommerce on a single platform.\n\n## The Route to Success\n\nMayrand and Yaksa had a challenge to deliver the new digital platform with full\nB2B & B2C ecommerce capabilities in just 6 months. Yaksa ran the definition\nphase workshops with Mayrand to determine quickly the key elements to build the\nfoundation and also prioritize the features that would have to be there at\nlaunch. Mayrand’s Sophie Schwartz was very knowledgeable and had a vast\nexperience in deploying ecommerce websites which helped a lot in focusing on the\nright parts of the implementation and taking quick decisions.\n\nThe team had to keep in mind that the integration with Mayrand’s ERP tool would\nbe temporary as it was already planned to be changed within a year, hence\ninfluencing the architecture of the connection. The solution proved successful\nas Mayrand managed to switch ERP with no downtime on its eCommerce website.\n\nBy June 2019 the website was launched, and the target feature set was achieved.\n\n## Mayrand's Merchandising Magic\n\n- **My stockroom:** Customers can browse Mayrand's product catalog with a personalised view of products previously bought.\n- **Loyalty:** Users now register and renew online their loyalty card and start earning benefits immediately\n- **Featured Products:** Allow merchandisers to boost positioning of specific products in browsing and search\n- **Predictive Search:** Auto-complete search based on the current most popular search keyword that create sales conversions\n- **Scale & Perform:** Built to perform and scale against high volume increase\n- **Personalized Pricing:** Members can browse the site viewing and purchasing products with their eligible personalized prices and promotions\n- **Fulfilment Experience:** Receive SMS and email updates about grocery orders, assembly and delivery status.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n- Commerce Connect\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.mayrand.ca/",

    "content": "# Audiogon increases email revenue by 171%\n\n## Audiogon evolves their email marketing strategy\n\nAs the industry's most prominent and most-respected brand in the high-end audio,\nAudiogon provides a marketplace for people to buy, sell, trade, and discuss\nhigh-end audio equipment. Built for audiophiles by audiophiles, the company has\nbeen a mainstay of the audio world since the late '90s, providing a one-stop,\ncomprehensive resource for HiFi enthusiasts who are deeply passionate, informed\nand have strong preferences.\n\nBefore using Optimizely, Audiogon's email strategy consisted of a single weekly\nnewsletter because getting more targeted through segmentation was next to\nimpossible. Considering Audiogon’s incredibly passionate audience, with highly\nspecific and technical preferences, this was hardly the brand’s full potential.\nBlocking Audiogon from increasing revenue from digital channels, was a lack of\naccess to reliable customer data and the means to activate their data.\n\nBrands like Audiogon need a composable solution that addresses multifaceted and\nevolving problems. Powering our market-leading Digital Experience Platform\n(DXP), Optimizely empowers brands with an activated CDP. We call it Optimizely\nData Platform (ODP). In addition to storing data in the CDP (Customer Data\nPlatform), Data Platform makes recommendations for marketers at brands like\nAudiogon on what to do with it. As a result, marketers have a real-time record\nof the customer context and predictions for best-next touchpoints to drive\nrevenue.\n\n## Customer data in the wrong frequency\n\nCentral to Audiogon’s problem was customer data. It was unreliable, and for the\nmost part they could not access it. Their earlier marketing technology stack\nlacked any intelligence around customer browsing or purchase history. The\ncustomer context wasn't something Audiogon could access in real-time. Without\nsegments or automated campaigns, the marketing team would do their best to\ncollaborate with developers and the IT (Information Technology) department to\nrun code queries on databases such as CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and\nother internal systems for customer data. As a result, the marketing team would\nhave to wait for inaccurate and inconsistent data.\n\n\"Delivering this consistent, cross-channel experience has been seamless. We\nsimply create the segment, sync it over to Facebook and Google Ad Managers, and\nthe ads run. I don't have to worry about it. It works with no manual adjustments\nand saves me a ton of time.\"\n\nJustin Roberson\n\nDirector of Digital Marketing, Audiogon\n\n\"If I wanted a segment of customers that met specific qualifications like 'spent\n$2,000 or more with our brand in a month,' I'd have to ask a developer or\ndatabase manager to run an SQL query for me,\" said Justin Roberson, Director of\nDigital Marketing at Audiogon.\n\n\"The data would come back a week or two later as a .CSV (Comma Separated Value)\nfile that I would have to upload to our email platform manually. So, it was\nalways outdated, and the process was inefficient—and this cycle would continue\nevery month,\" Roberson added.\n\n## Dialing in on the proper signal\n\nNow, with Data Platform, Audiogon's marketing team can self-service their\ncustomer data needs. Self-sufficiency has been an immediate and tangible benefit\nfor Roberson.\n\n\"We're not dependent on other people's schedules, and we can easily obtain and\nact on customer data on our own,\" Roberson explained.\n\nAdditionally, with Data Platform, customer data and campaign execution are\ncombined into a single system, cutting manual uploads and empowering the\nmarketing team to move even faster on customer insights.\n\nThanks to the customer lifecycle dashboard within Data Platform, Roberson and\nhis team need only a glance to understand performance and what to do next but\nhave the flexibility to dive into customer data and ask critical questions. For\nexample, while Roberson was building custom dashboards in the past, he can now\nquickly find increases in at-risk and churned customers month-over-month. Plus,\nhe no longer must manually piece data together from multiple platforms to\nunderstand customer health.\n\n\"I love being able to look up a user's lifetime value and purchase history\nwithin the same platform as email [marketing],\" Roberson said. \"I can compare\nthe performance of different groups of users across campaigns and sources to\nmeasure improvements. For example, I can see the lifetime value of users that\nvisit our forum more than ten times in two months to figure out whether forum\nengagement increases LTV (lifetime value). Other platforms don't offer these\ninsights.\"\n\nAccording to Roberson, one of the most significant benefits of using Data\nPlatform has been the ease of acting on customer insights.\n\n[Data Platform] drastically reduces the time from opportunity discovery to\ncampaign execution. I can uncover something about a specific segment, and I can\nat once target that audience with an email. It saves me hours.\n\nJustin Roberson\n\nDirector of Digital Marketing, Audiogon\n\n## Seamlessly delivering a consistent, cross-channel experience\n\n70 percent of Audiogon's revenue comes from dealers, while 30 percent comes from\nprivate users. Since new dealers generate recurring revenue and these leads are\nmuch more lucrative, they must uncover them early and later coach dealers on how\nto best use the site to be successful.\n\nThere was no way for the Audiogon team to identify the behavior that qualifies a\n'dealer lead' with their earlier technology. But with Data Platform, they can\nuncover these leads quickly. First, the Audiogon team dynamically segments on\nspecific dealer behaviors—defined as new user registration in the last ten weeks\nand seven or more listings in that timeframe. Then, they promote the Audiogon\nDealer Program to these customers by sending targeted emails and corresponding\nFacebook and Google ads with steep discounts. From there, the sales team can see",

I don't have to worry about\nit. It works with no manual adjustments and saves me a ton of time.\"\n\nBehavioral segmentation has enabled Audiogon to do more with cart abandonment\ncampaigns, offering different incentives to different users. For example, new\nusers who registered in the last 30 days and have never bought through Audiogon\nreceive 50 percent off their first listing if they abandon their cart.\n\nAccording to Roberson, these types of behaviorally triggered campaigns would\nhave been impossible to do with their earlier setup. And Data Platform\nomnichannel campaign management makes it easy for the team to send multi-touch\nabandon cart emails with incremental incentives.\n\n## Optimizely is a sound choice for Audiogon\n\nFor Audiogon, Data Platform's potent fusion of customer data store, revenue-\nspecific dashboards, and activations through email and advertising made the\ndifference.\n\nSince switching to Data Platform, Audiogon has doubled monthly signups from the\nprecious dealer persona type. With intuitive segmentation, Audiogon has\nincreased its email-generated revenue by 171 percent. In addition, their average\ncampaign revenue has grown from $197 with their earlier platform to $534 with\nData Platform.\n\nThe team has a handful of tactics to get numbers like this, all made possible by\nOPD. For example, the team implemented a new user welcome email with a coupon\nfor users' first listing, pointing them to other properties. Since starting this\ncampaign, traffic to Audiogon's other properties has increased a whopping 200\npercent annually.\n\nIn the end, Roberson said he'd been highly impressed with Optimizely's support\nfrom customer success. \"I've never gone more than a day without a solution to an\nissue,\" he said. The team doesn't just resolve issues; they uncover\nopportunities and make recommendations to drive revenue. They're transparent and\nresponsive to our needs, and they genuinely want us to succeed. I've never had\nthis with any other provider.\"\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Data Platform\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.audiogon.com/",

Known for its presence in the oil and gas industry, Shell\nalso manufactures and markets chemicals as well as invests in innovative sources\nof power.\n\nOperating at a global scale in over 70 countries with over 80,000 employees,\nShell’s growing teams needed collaboration processes to drive seamless daily\noperations.\n\nThree years ago, Shell came on board with Optimizely Content Marketing Platform\n(CMP). This partnership has allowed Shell to empower its teams to be more agile,\ndrive marketing transformation, scale and support business demand and execute an\nintegrated approach resulting in more alignment, efficiency and better brand\nexperiences.\n\n## Shell fuel internal marketing process with Optimizely Content Marketing\n\nPlatform\n\nOperating as a large multinational organization, with thousands of employees,\nstakeholders and requests brings many challenges and complexities. Prior to\npartnering with Optimizely, Shell’s marketing tasks were communicated the old-\nschool way via ticketing systems, spreadsheets, and emails.Not only were Shell’s\nmarketing stakeholders finding it difficult to collaborate, but they were also\nworking in silos without full visibility of their content landscape.\n\nWith strict brand compliance and processes to abide by, Shell recognized the\nproblem at hand.\n\nAs Shell Brands International CEO & Vice-Chairman Dean Aragon explains, “like so\nmany modern organizations, our success hinges on being able to maximize\nvisibility, enable faster turnaround times, and minimize duplication and waste.”\n\nShell quickly began its search for an integrated collaboration platform that\ncould unify various brand processes in its complex digital ecosystem, and drive\ncontent effectiveness and efficiency without compromising on user experience.\n\n## Unifying processes with Optimizely Content Marketing Platform\n\nOnce Optimizely CMP was identified by Shell for its industry-leading\ncapabilities in supporting marketing teams to plan campaigns, collaborate on\nwork and produce content, Shell’s teams have been maximizing the user-friendly\nplatform.\n\nAt Shell, the intuitive Optimizely CMP is utilized for:\n\n- Shared and integrated planning (planning content & campaigns and managing budgets)\n- Streamlining work management and creative services (handling and filtering hundreds of creative requests a month from internal employees and external agencies)\n- Asset governance and brand compliance (managing tens of thousands of approvals using CMP and artificial intelligence integrations)\n\n## Use case 1: Shared and integrated planning\n\nA company of Shell’s size risks losing visibility when numerous campaigns are\nhappening concurrently.\n\n_Figure 1: Shell's Calendar view with filter options on Optimizely Content\nMarketing Platform._\n\nWith **Calendars** , Shell’s stakeholders have holistic transparency across all\nregions for better insight and are empowered to facilitate longer-term, cross-\nagency planning. Filters and permission settings enable employees to toggle\nbetween a bird’s eye view and tasks to focus on.\n\nThe **Campaigns** capability has moved ideation into a shared, collaborative\nworkspace easily accessed by Shell’s teams instead of their previous practice of\nusing emails.\n\nNot only has Optimizely CMP increased company-wide visibility on campaigns, but\nit has also improved collaboration and communication between employees for\nimproved efficiency. Furthermore, budgets also benefit from this holistic\napproach as Shell’s teams can ensure campaigns are on track.\n\n## Use case 2: Streamlining work management and creative services\n\n_Figure 2: Shell's Work Requests view on Optimizely Content Marketing Platform._\n\nHundreds of requests come in from internal employees and external partners every\nmonth.\n\n**Work Requests** automatically route and collectively prioritize inbound\nrequests from a global set of stakeholders. It serves as the single-entry point\nfor brand approvals and project creation. Submissions are routed accordingly,\nvalidated and a corresponding project is created with an assigned project\nmanager.\n\nThe project manager further uses Optimizely CMP to handle budgeting, asset\ncreation, and other tasks pertaining to the campaign with flexible options to\ncustomize processes.\n\nWithin Work Requests, there is also an intuitive UX to request work provided to\nstakeholders with capacity.\n\nLike so many modern organizations, our success hinges on being able to maximize\nvisibility, enable faster turnaround times, and minimize duplication and waste.\n\nDean Aragon\n\nShell Brands International CEO & Vice-Chairman\n\n## Use case 3: Asset governance and brand compliance\n\n_Figure 3: Shell's Tasks & Workflows view on Optimizely Content Marketing\nPlatform._\n\nIt goes without saying that an international organization like Shell will\nrequire strict brand compliance to ensure unity in its marketing materials.\n\nAt one point, over 40,000 communication assets were sent for approval within\njust eight months.\n\n**Tasks & Workflows** enable Shell’s teams to monitor and govern the production\nof assets with proper review and brand approvals. This capability provides Shell\nwith a streamlined approach for ensuring compliance across all content activity.\n\nIn addition, Shell partnered with Optimizely to integrate a machine vision\ntechnology to screen for brand compliance. This AI-powered self-checker was\nintroduced to Shell’s agencies and is expected to save millions of dollars\nacross Shell globally.\n\n## Shell improves overall productivity and collaboration\n\nShell has grown leaps and bounds, onboarding seven new teams in 2022 alone.

It\nwanted to approach its content strategy with stories that cultivate relatability\nand understanding.\n\nSpirotech’s Digital Marketer, Laurens Costa, shared the previous solution\nprioritized ecommerce over content while the next solution the business was\nmoving towards did not meet the basic requirements of its digital vision.\n\nThe team went through multiple attempts to establish its digital footing and\ndecided that their ideal digital solution should consist of:\n\n- Integration between PIM and website\n- A functional website that promotes engagement through content\n- Accessible resources for wholesalers and customers on a strong CMS\n- Support for multilanguage and multisite\n- A flexible and practical backend interface\n\n## \\*\\*Finding its footing with an exceptional content strategy rooted in creating\n\nawareness\\*\\*\n\nHaving heard of and seen implementations of Optimizely, Costa was encouraged to\nexplore Optimizely’s capabilities for Spirotech. He was aware that selecting the\nright Optimizely partner that understood Spirotech’s needs could greatly\naccelerate its digital success.\n\nSpirotech landed on Optimizely partner Delaware after exploring its options\noutside and within Optimizely. Delaware and Spirotech started their partnership\non the right foot by establishing clear communication every step of the way.\n\nDelaware’s proactiveness made it easy for the Spirotech team to work with, with\nthe experienced Optimizely partner sharing its expertise to speed up\ndevelopments. It also helped that the Spirotech team and Delaware were in\nconstant contact, streamlining the communication flow.\n\nWith Delaware’s expertise with Optimizely’s solutions, Spirotech was able to\nachieve one of its immediate goals of integrating a PIM with its website,\nproviding the Spirotech team with a holistic, bird’s eye view of the business’s\nproduct data. Changes made on the PIM are immediately reflected on Spirotech’s\nwebsite, reducing unnecessary and error-prone edits.\n\nSpirotech’s content-focused digital strategy spurred its extensive utilization\nof Optimizely’s Content Management capabilities. With its new website built on\n.NET and Microsoft’s Azure, Spirotech had a digital solution that was fast,\nsecure, and capable of handling spikes in traffic, allowing customers and\nwholesalers easy access to Spirotech resources.\n\nOptimizely’s intuitive CMS also helped Spirotech craft its content strategy,\nenabling the Spirotech team to create great content experiences to educate site\nvisitors. Since Optimizely’s Authoring & Layout blocks are easily customizable\nwith drag-and-drop, the team can focus fully on crafting exceptional stories,\nstreamlining the content creation process.\n\nIn addition, Spirotech leveraged Optimizely’s Multisite Development to build its\nmultisite digital solution using a shared database and content assets. Content\nand Media Management are utilized in tandem to handle content permissions and\npublishing, empowering the team to make quick edits that can be reflected\ninstantaneously.\n\nSpirotech’s worldwide presence requires its digital solution to cater to a\nmultitude of languages, one of the key reasons Spirotech chose Optimizely.

The solution lay in a massive\noverhaul based on Optimizely.\n\nSISAB (Skolfastigheter i Stockholm AB) felt an urgent need to update and\nmodernize its website. The website was not mobile-friendly and the design needed\nmodernization. The work began with internal interviews at SISAB and surveys\namong the company’s stakeholders and tenants. These preparations provided a\nbroader basis and a better understanding of what users wanted and needed from\nthe SISAB website.\n\nThe project had a tight timetable. The development work began in October 2020\nand everything was ready for launch—on time—in February 2021.\n\n## **The solution**\n\nConsid—a Gold Partner to Optimizely and a Framework Agreement Supplier to\nSISAB—was tasked with developing the new website. Feedback from the interviews\nand surveys was used to create specific experience sketches for navigation,\ninterface, and how the user interface would attract and support the needs of the\ntarget groups.\n\nOne of the basic measures in the project was renewing the website’s technical\nbase. Optimizely and the frontend framework were upgraded to meet new\nfunctionality needs. The upgrade was also done to support the newly developed\ndesign and satisfy the requirements to make the website responsive and mobile-\nfriendly.\n\nThe search functionality of the existing website necessitated the inclusion of a\ncompletely new search function in the project. The entire website was built with\na focus on flexibility and simplicity to make things easier for the SISAB\neditors.\n\n## **The result**\n\nThe new SISAB website is welcoming, modern, and user-friendly. This time around,\nit is adapted for both computers and cell phones which better meets the needs of\nthe target groups. Relevant content is also made available in a simple and\nattractive package—easing discovery and understanding.\n\nThe new search engine makes it easier for both employees and visitors to find\nthe right information. The possibility of adjusting, configuring and weighting\nthe search engine has made a major contribution to the overall improvement. Not\nonly has SISAB received an easy-to-edit and intuitive web platform but the\nwebsite is now also better adapted to Swedish accessibility laws.\n\nOne success factor was that development had effective and transparent\ncollaboration with the support of agile methodology. The website has now\nswitched to administration and an agile way of working with continual\nimprovements.\n\nA very successful upgrade of our website!\n\nSanna Brolin\n\nSystem Administrator, Sisab\n\n## **About SISAB**\n\nSISAB (Skolfastigheter i Stockholm AB) manages and develops schools and\npreschools in Stockholm, Sweden.

All products are designed\nto drive good oral care habits, while keeping products fresh and effective with\na quarterly refill delivery service.\n\nquip has gained a loyal following by offering modern products that encourage\nusers to build better oral care habits, , delivering tips and tricks to its many\ncustomers and incentivizing them to improve their oral hygiene with its\ninnovative mobile app.\n\nThe app pairs with quip smart devices like, for example, a Bluetooth-enabled\ntoothbrush and rewards points to users for completing oral healthcare tasks like\nsuccessfully brushing teeth twice a day for two minutes each time. These points\ncan then be redeemed for various discounts and prizes. The company has disrupted\nthe oral care industry and continues to grow rapidly, expanding its product\nofferings and reaching new customers across the globe.\n\nquip's journey with Optimizely started in February 2022**Problem**\n\nquip had utilized experimentation sporadically throughout the company’s rise to\nthe top of the oral healthcare industry. However, to increase testing velocity,\ngain an understanding of what to test, validate ideas and regenerate an internal\nculture of experimentation throughout the company, a new solution and updated\napproach was needed.\n\nTimothy P, Director of Digital Product at quip, shared that “the e-commerce\nteam, the marketing teams, the creative teams, the product team… we were\nhamstrung by our inability to run quick tests.” Timothy P envisioned a culture\nof experimentation throughout the entire organization, where all teams could\nindependently brainstorm, launch, and report their own tests without needing\nhelp and support from the digital team.\n\nThe different respective teams needed a holistic testing platform that allowed\nthem to quickly test simple ideas and hypotheses that needed validation like\ncosmetic, copy or design changes, as well as more complex hypotheses like site\nnavigation changes that required more engineering support.\n\nTherefore, Optimizely’s full experimentation suite, containing both Web\nExperimentation and Feature Experimentation products was selected by the quip\nteam to support the brand on its A/B testing journey.\n\nOptimizely’s experimentation platform is the complete solution for A/B testing\nand feature flagging. It satisfies both an engineering team that needs robust\nSDKs and APIs to build complex experiments, and non-technical users to create\nand view the results of their own experiments. It satisfies both ends of the\nspectrum and is the complete solution in my mind\n\nTimothy P\n\nDirector of Digital Product\n\n**Solution**\n\nAfter a smooth onboarding process, the quip team quickly got to work in\nleveraging Optimizely’s experimentation platforms to elevate the digital\nexperience for its subscribers whilst testing and iterating on new ideas,\nproduct launches and conversion optimization and strategy.\n\nThe velocity of experiments has dramatically increased throughout the\norganization as technical and non-technical users are now empowered to run their\nown experiments and validate their own ideas without directly involving the\ndigital team.\n\nThe organization now utilises key Web Experimentation features such as the\n**Visual Editor** , and **Stats Engine** , which makes sure that experiments\nreach statistical significance as quickly as possible.\n\nTimothy detailed that the accessible and digestible dashboards ensure that it’s\neasy for teams to set up custom events, simple for all teams to understand which\nexperiments are producing a positive impact and to be confident in the results.\nThe Quip team now usually have “between 3-6 tests running concurrently at any\ngiven time” according to Timothy, highlighting the culture of experimentation\nthat has spread through the organization. The expectation now is that all ideas\nare tested, experimented on, and validated before any further action is taken.\n\n**Feature flags** have helped quip to gate certain features on their mobile app\nto safeguard against any potential buggy releases. When releasing application\nupdates on mobile, the turnaround can be slower than web or desktop releases as\napp updates have to be reviewed by the respective application stores. Therefore,\nthe team utilises feature flags to mark beta features so that, in the event of a\nfeature release not going as planned, they can quickly toggle it on or off,\nproviding both more flexibility and peace of mind.\n\n## Integrations\n\nOptimizely’s **Web Experimentation** platform integrates seamlessly with quip’s\nbackend programs and applications. The integration with Segment, quip’s Customer\nData Platform that tracks, cleans and organises customer data, allows the\nproduct team to simply funnel all user events from Segment into Optimizely’s\nplatform.

Using an Optimizely app that\nintegrates with the CMS, content administrators can choose different content\nvariations to display to customers based on which experiment variation the user\nis enrolled in. Server-side experimentation is enabled without pushing new code\nper experiment, saving developers time. This integration makes testing different\ncopy variations smooth and harmonious whilst providing more flexibility to\nquip’s content administrators.**In Depth\\*\\***Use Case 1\\*\\*\n\nA key part of quip’s testing efforts focussed on nurturing the health of its\nsubscription business, by ensuring that it retains and improves its customer\nlife time value (CLV).\n\nquip’s personal care products, like toothbrushes, are accompanied by\nsubscriptions for refillable products, like toothbrush heads. Ensuring that\ncustomers purchase as many refillable products is important to increase a\ncustomer’s LTV.\n\nquip’s previous checkout process for refillable products pushed users to select\na product, checkout and provide an option for either a one-time purchase or a\nrecurring subscription. The quip team hypothesised that changing the Product\nDetail Pages (PDP) to include a quantity selector for refills earlier in the\ncheckout process could have a positive impact.\n\nAlthough there was a fear that adding this feature could clog the PDPs and give\ncustomers choice overload, the quip team set up this experiment utilizing\nOptimizely’s Web Experimentation. URL redirects were used to split test the\noriginal PDP page where customers could not choose refill quantity and a new\nversion of the PDP page where they could choose refill quantity.\n\nThe new variant saw significantly higher conversion rate purchase units per\ntransaction, and subscription units per transaction for brush head refills.\n\n### Product Display Page - Control Variation\n\n### Product Display Page - Test Variation\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the next 18 months, quip aims to continue its focus on improving customer LTV\nwhilst launching new and innovative products and expanding its horizons in the\noral healthcare space.\n\nThe team will continue to increase its testing velocity with Optimizely to\ncontinue to empower more non-technical employees with easy-to-use tools to\nenhance the company’s experimentation culture.\n\n#### Industry\n\nRetail\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Feature Experimentation\n- Web Experimentation",

    "content": "# Institute for Supply Management simplifies their tech stack\n\n100 years of excellence in Supply Management, scaled to meet digital aspirations\n\n## Serving a professional community of members online\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management® (ISM®) is the first and largest not-for-\nprofit professional supply management organization worldwide. Founded in 1915,\nISM has over 50,000 members across 100 countries.\n\nFor more than a century, Institute for Supply Management® (ISM) has impacted\nsupply management and the purchasing profession through best in class education,\ncertification, leadership development and research. Thousands have received\nISM's coveted certifications including the Certified Professional in Supply\nManagement (CPSM) and Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD)\ndesignations. The organization continuously evolve as the profession evolves and\nhelp lead and advance the profession of supply management.\n\nTheir mission: To advance the practice of supply management to drive value and\ncompetitive advantage, and contribute to a prosperous, sustainable world.\n\n## Delivering research that gets the attention of Wall Street and global\n\neconomists\n\nFirst reported in 1931 at the request of the US President and consistently\ndelivered (except during WWII), ISM developed the methodology and has delivered\nwhat is known today as the ISM® Report On Business®. It is made up of\nManufacturing (PMI®), Services (PMI™) and newly introduced Hospital (PMI™) and\nentails a national survey of purchasing managements, measuring supply chain\nrelated changes in the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. The all-\nimportant report is widely considered as one of the most reliable barometers of\nthe US economy, helping provide relevant information for the national\ngovernment, Wall Street and economists worldwide.\n\nBeyond the research, ISM at their core, takes a strong stance on corporate\nsocial responsibility, ethics and sustainability. That's why they are not only\nheavily involved in gathering data and trends, but also in the continuing\neducation for all those pursuing and currently in the supply chain profession.\n\n## Changing digital presence\n\nWith a 100-year history, change is something ISM embraces. It’s something that\nhas helped keep them relevant all this time. When it comes to digital, it’s a\nlarge part of what they do today to connect with their global community. ISM\nworks hard to implement the voice-of-customer into their digital operations and\ntheir approach to infrastructure to enable them digitally. Unleashing Optimizely\nContent Cloud has allowed the team to serve members in a more sustainable\nfashion, reducing the amount of print needed for published materials. Their\ndigital experience platform has improved the reach of their content - it's\nsimply easier to facilitate to more people in a meaningful and personalized way.\n\n## The making of ISM 2.0\n\nISM’s prior website truly didn’t represent the thought leadership and pioneering\nspirit of the organization. They needed a platform that would emulate their\nmission digitally. They deployed Content Cloud to serve as a member-first\ncommunity platform that provided great content and research, including\nincorporating their magazine, _Inside Supply Management_.\n\nThe ISM digital platform utilizes Marketing Automation to convey a more\npersonalized experience and showcase the ISM brand in a more relevant way. Users\nare given the opportunity to access what educational courses they've purchased\nand easily see what their membership status is.\n\nISM leverages the power to, at any time, learn how the website is performing\nagainst expectation. They can see whether produced content was successfully\nconsumed, or whether a user was not as engaged as desired. This helps inform\ntheir content strategy by dictating what needs to be done in the future to drive\nengagement and overall membership satisfaction.\n\n## Why ISM are delighted with their digital platform:\n\n- Technology peace-of-mind\n- Modernized technology infrastructure\n- The ability to handle important, sensitive content\n- Mobile friendly\n- Ease-of-use\n- Decentralized management of content\n- The ability to support future digital growth\n- Personalization capabilities\n- Reliable technology partner\n\n## Long term buy-in\n\nThe right partner is important to enable ISM on their digital journey. That's\nwhy they made the investment in Optimizely for the long-term strategy. The next\nstep will be further development of their Commerce Cloud environment to deliver\neven greater digital experiences for members. Personalization and customizing\nthe front-end of the site will continue to increase member engagement, helping\nto cement ISM's mission.\n\nIn terms of the future, ISM is also excited by the opportunity to surprise and\ndelight members without 'heavy lifting'. Optimizely's Digital Experience\nPlatform delivers Content, Commerce and Personalization on one screen,\nsimplifying ISM's technology stack. Therefore, this is the single, unified tool\nthat will help ISM further connect with professional communities within the\nsupply chain.\n\n#### Industry\n\nEducation\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.ismworld.org/",

Learn more now.\n\n## Challenge\n\nHunter Engineering, a leading automobile service equipment manufacturer, wanted\nto rethink digital growth. It was 2019 and Hunter had just partnered with\nOptimizely to utilize its market-leading CMS solution. Hunter was no longer\ninvesting in MarTech headaches, but real outcomes.\n\nHowever, what laid on the horizon for Hunter as they launched their revamped\nsite in Q1 2020, would shift priorities at the top of every executive’s list.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced buyers to turn to digital purchasing. Pandemic-\ninduced social restrictions meant buyers turned to digital channels to conduct\nbusiness, and in the world of B2B, where reliable purchasing and fulfillment is\nbusiness-critical, Hunter found themselves needing to make a chess move. Their\ncustomers, who conducted business online, over-the-phone, and in-person, now\nrequired trusted online purchasing. Instead of pulling back and cutting costs,\nHunter invested in customer experiences and satisfaction – launching commerce to\ncome out stronger and more reliable to customers throughout the pandemic.\n\nFurthermore, with their legacy CMS solution previously limiting how employees\ncould create and manage content online, and now running on Optimizely, Hunter\nwas equipped with the technology and strategy to take their business into the\ndigital age.\n\nYet, what became quickly apparent with a new, scalable CMS solution was a more\ndeep-rooted challenge: their team was not digitally enabled to generate content\nat a rapid pace, minimizing their potential for digital transformation and\ncontinued industry leadership.\n\nRecognizing the multi-faceted challenge amid a global pandemic, Hunter put faith\ninto their new partner, Optimizely, to support their growth through content,\nmarketing, and e-commerce challenges using a single, unified platform:\nOptimizely One.\n\n## Solution\n\nFrom 2019 to 2023, Hunter Engineering, with Optimizely as their e-commerce and\nmarketing software partner, achieved total digital transformation across their\ne-commerce site and internal marketing workflows.\n\n**This outcome was based on two key initiatives** :\n\n- Launch an intuitive content management system and robust commerce backend built for scale\n- Modernize content production, collaboration, and workflows\n\nBy partnering with Optimizely, Hunter Engineering took a targeted approach to\nsolving marketing challenges across the entire marketing lifecycle, helping\nHunter respond to market volatility with growth and customer satisfaction. This\nstrategic transformation required key capabilities and support from Optimizely\nto bring the vision to life. Now, let’s uncover how Optimizely was best\npositioned in technology and strategy to help Hunter Engineering win.\n\n#### Building for Scale: Using a trusted Content Management System to grow the\n\nbottom line\n\nWhat launched Hunter Engineering from industry leader to global champion of\nautomobile service equipment was their investment in Optimizely’s Content\nManagement System. As Hunter peered into the 2020s, they identified a few key\nareas their CMS needed to support their strategy. 1) They need a CMS solution to\nintegrate without blowing up costs 2) They want to provide exceptional customer\nexperiences 3) They want to scale that exceptional customer experience globally.\n\nChoosing Optimizely, Hunter Engineering coordinated with implementation partners\nwho accelerated integration and customization processes of the Optimizely-driven\nsite. Optimizely’s PaaS CMS solution offers organizations the ability to develop\ntruly bespoke and brand-driven experiences that delight customers and improve\nengagement while increasing conversions. Wanting to take full advantage of\nOptimizely’s CMS capabilities, and being pleased with early results, Hunter\nadded six new in-house developers to ensure they were continually developing and\nimproving their site.\n\nSecondly, Hunter placed an intense focus on personalization. Hunter creates a\npersonalized experience based on zip codes and location for customers to connect\nwith local representatives who can have a face-to-face conversation with buyers\nto help guide them through a purchase.\n\nLastly, being built for scale, Hunter used improved admin roles, permissions,\nand workflows to enable their marketing team to create without restrictions.\nGoodbye to the days fighting for licensing during new hire onboarding.\n\nOptimizely is a catalyst for international growth, working with over 1,000\norganizations across the globe.

Optimizely's CMS solution enables organizations\nto deliver multi-site, language, and regional experiences that make it easy for\nanyone, just about anywhere, to complete a purchase online. Now adding their\n9th(!) language translation of their site, Hunter Engineering is growing their\nglobal footprint and helping lead the market in automobile service equipment\nmanufacturing.\n\n#### Boosting sales, permanently: Optimizely’s Commerce Connect\n\nDuring the second half of 2020, Hunter Engineering felt the impact of global\nconsumer trends shift to more online purchasing. With Optimizely’s Commerce\nConnect, Hunter launched their customer portal, allowing customers to connect\nwith local salespeople, purchase replacement parts, and execute due diligence on\npurchasing new Hunter products. Having a trusted digital presence where\ncustomers could execute purchases enabled Hunter to remain competitive during\ngreater economic headwinds.\n\nAs a PaaS deployment, Hunter first relied on partners’ developers to craft a\ncompelling site, later on, taking advantage of Optimizely’s ability to scale,\nthey employed an in-house team to create engaging content and product\nexperiences that generate interest, guide customers to purchase, and give them a\nreason to come back.\n\nGlobalization, integrating homegrown solutions, and optimizing commerce\nexperiences is where Hunter is focused now, and with Commerce Connect, they are\nable to grow without risking frustrating their employees with a less than ideal\ncommerce platform.\n\n#### Creating a modern marketing team: Optimizely’s Content Marketing Platform.\n\nHunter Engineering realized they needed change but lacked the partner to help\ninitiate it. After three years working with Optimizely to launch their CMS and\nCommerce solution, a more human challenge awaited them: Now equipped with a\nmodern CMS and commerce solution, how can Hunter Engineering create content that\nis worth delivering to customers at a global scale?\n\n“We were printing out brochures and web pages, handwriting notes, scanning it\nin, emailing it to another, and rinse and repeating – it was chaos.” Tommy\nMaitz, Director of Marketing, Hunter Engineering\n\nInstead of continuing to build content through outdated and siloed methods and\nchannels, Hunter, from top-to-bottom, committed to digital, injecting real-time\ncollaboration and transparency into workstreams to produce high quality work at\nscale.\n\n“Using a free version of the platform (CMP), we showed our executive team how it\nwould be used for project and campaign management... they clearly saw the\nvalue.”\n\nIn CMP, Hunter can centralize campaign planning with total visibility into\neverything teams are creating and who’s creating it – boosting collaboration and\nimproving content quality. Also, integrating with solutions like Microsoft Teams\nand Jira empowers their entire organization to deliver expert insight into\ncontent and marketing.\n\nWithout CMP, you’re looking at emails, teams' messages, notes and more. Using\nCMP is Hunter committing to the digital age and wanting to do it in a better\nway.\n\nTommy Maitz\n\nDirector of Marketing, Hunter Engineering\n\nHosting several major trade shows, launching multiple new products, and running\ndozens of campaigns a year and entering the arena of content-first marketing,\nHunter uses Optimizely’s Content Marketing platform to keep teams organized,\ninformed, and empowered to create meaningful work.\n\n## Results\n\nHunter Engineering’s partnership with Optimizely was nothing short of a success.\nAfter implementing Optimizely’s CMS, Hunter has seen a 72% increase in website\ntraffic.\n\nFrom November 2020 to May 2022, Hunter saw, on average, a 20% MoM increase in\norder volume — solidifying digital as a strong customer engagement channel for\nHunter.\n\nAnd finally, CMP has empowered employees to become more efficient, improve\nfeedback, and help foster a culture of high-quality collaboration.\n\nI don’t know that I can place a value on CMP...when you don’t have a centralized\nsolution like CMP, it’s chaos.\n\nTommy Maitz\n\nDirector of Marketing, Hunter Engineering\n\nNow, Hunter Engineering is poised for further success. They launched a\ncustomized and trusted CMS solution to increase content production and improve\ndelivery. They launched a digital commerce channel where buyers can complete\npurchases without human assistance, improving revenue growth, and releasing a\nknot in employee collaboration and communication needed for growth.\n\nLooking forward, Hunter is investing in their shift to digital. Focusing on\nglobal rollout of their website, Hunter is forging their path as a digital\nleader in manufacturing.\n\n“One of the biggest benefits of Optimizely has been the ability to scale - to\ntake on challenges we’ve known we’ve wanted to take on but have never had the\nright partner. We’re all in on Optimizely.”\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Commerce Connect\n- Content Management System\n- Content Marketing Platform\n- Optimizely One",

The Swedish multinational offers designs and sustainable solutions,\nunder brands including Electrolux, AEG, Zanussi and Frigidaire.\n\nThey operate different areas including kitchen, laundry, small appliances and\nhome care and services. Products within Major Appliances include refrigerators,\nfreezers, cookers, dryers, washing machines, dishwashers, room air-conditioners\nand microwave ovens. Small appliances include vacuum cleaners and other small\nappliances. Professional Products consists of foodservice equipment and laundry\nsolutions for professional users.\n\nWith a multitude of different products and markets being served, it was\nparamount Electrolux possessed a relevant content and ecommerce platform to\nattract and convert addressable opportunities. This would come in the form of\nmuch more than just a glossy digital catalogue. Instead, it would enable direct-\nto-consumer ecommerce and deliver a better service to end-users.\n\nCatering to the differing needs across Europe, requires an approach that is\nlocal to each visitor. This meant the digital experience platform needed to\nconnect different services together and adhere to internal governance around\nwarranties, national scrappage requirements and local installation guides.\n\nEach region and brand would have its own site architecture that would be multi-\npurposed. It was vital these were balanced, so they were not product content\nheavy but instead included elements of inspiration. The aim was to marry the\nmultiple sites under one digital framework built upon a powerful content and\ncommerce ecosystem. This would enable markets the digital freedom to work\nresponsively within their respective territories.\n\nElectrolux selected Optimizely for their newly devised disruptive approach. The\nbest-in-class digital experience platform is designed to meet the purpose and\nscale of this pan-european project which covers around 100 sites.\n\n## Designing against international needs\n\nOne of the most complex needs revolved around the differing expectations\ndifferent regions would have when it came to buying online. Electrolux, with the\nhelp of Optimizely partner Bombayworks, designed a digital architecture that\nappeases the intricate asks of a modern ecommerce experience. Clear structure is\nimportant for the different brands. Visitors are presented illustrative graphics\nbefore any detailed content. The plug-in with Translations.com allows sites to\nbe instantly translated to 11 key languages. They are semantically translated so\neach translation carries the same meaning.\n\nElectrolux’s entire digital estate is geared towards making transactions happen.\nBy smartly deploying creative content in the right areas of the site,\nprospective visitors are natively guided to desired products that meet their\nneeds. Even with today’s savvy online browsers, who no longer shop in a linear\nfashion, Electrolux cater to this behavior. They understand and accept visitors\nusing multiple tabs to compare and evaluate products to form a purchasing\ndecision. As a result, Electrolux use their Optimizely estate as a story telling\nexperience. Their content strategy includes aspects of blending the ‘who we are’\nwith the needs and wants of target audiences. From there, detailed product\nliterature is provided aside inspiring visuals.\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Products used\n\n- Commerce Connect\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttps://www.electrolux.se/\n\n## In collaboration with:\n\nBombayworks\n\nBombayworks is your partner for digital growth.",

In the beginning,\nEDCO produced and distributed asphalt siding. As the world saw material\nadvancements, EDCO shifted from asphalt to aluminum and eventually to steel.\n\nArthur passed away in 2012 but his innovative, visionary and entrepreneurial\nspirit live on today through more than 200 EDCO employees. As the largest\nmanufacturer of pre-finished metal siding products in the United States, EDCO\noffers a comprehensive line of siding, roofing, soffit, fascia, and gutter\nsystems.\n\n## A focus on customer-prioritization\n\nOver the years, EDCO has built countless homes, employed hundreds of people and\nfostered a stronger community by delivering the highest quality products and\nproviding a relentless commitment to their customers.\n\nFrom the people behind desks, to the workers on the manufacturing line, and even\nto the employees in the warehouse who package and deliver products, every EDCO\nemployee bends over backwards for their customers. EDCO’s has a diverse customer\nbase of distributors. EDCO does not sell directly to homeowners.\n\n## EDCO’s transformation over the years\n\nHere are a few ways EDCO has changed over the years:\n\n- In the 40s, 50s and 60s, EDCO’s asphalt siding product served the company well. Today, EDCO manufactures beautiful, award-winning steel siding and roofing products with HD-enhanced print coats.\n\n- Just 20 years ago, EDCO hand loaded trucks. Today, EDCO boasts automated packaging, robotics and lift-assists.\n\n- 20 years ago, the sales office shared one computer with internet access for the CSRs. Every desk had a stack of carbon paper. The fax machine was their best friend. Today, of course, everyone has their own computer, reliance on the fax machine is going away and EDCO is finding new, better ways to serve their customers.\n\nThat’s where the partnership with Optimizely comes in. EDCO set out to serve\ntheir customers anytime, anywhere and from any device with Optimizely B2B\nCommerce Cloud.\n\n**Investing in eCommerce**\n\nEDCO’s initial goal for eCommerce was to provide their customers with improved\nconnectivity. They wanted to make it easier for customers to do business with\nthem. In addition, EDCO wanted to streamline their processes, gain efficiencies\nand improve accuracy with order entry.\n\nEDCO envisioned a future where customers could easily and efficiently serve\nthemselves online. EDCO wanted their customers to be able to easily access\nproducts, view pricing, check inventory levels and perform other digital self-\nservice tasks.\n\n**Building a team**\n\nAny digital transformation requires a strong team to lead the charge. At EDCO,\neCommerce is managed by a team of three.\n\nDean Karlsen is the Customer Support Manager responsible for managing content,\nthe online product catalog and pricing. Tim Walterson is EDCO’s Business Analyst\nDeveloper ensuring the integration between Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud and\nEDCO’s IFS ERP stays strong. Finally, Kristi Peterson, EDCO’s National Marketing\nManager plays a crucial role in building the website and driving EDCO’s\nmarketing strategy.\n\n## Why Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud?\n\nFinding an eCommerce system that accommodates the unique needs of a manufacturer\nisn’t always easy. EDCO narrowed their search by creating a 3-tiered approach to\nfinding the right fit: needs, wants and nice-to-have’s.\n\n“We found that Optimizely’s out-of-the-box solution fit all of our needs, most\nof our wants and even some of our nice-to-have’s,” said Dean Karlsen. “Other\nplatforms would have needed massive customizations to do what Optimizely\nConfigured Commerce is able to do natively.”\n\nOther factors that solidified the decision for EDCO included:\n\n- Robust B2B features in the platform\n- Business values were aligned\n- Guest user vs. login experience\n- User friendly admin console\n- Intuitive CMS\n- Complex pricing capabilities\n\n## EDCO’s new world with eCommerce\n\nEDCO went through a four-stage release to get their website up and running.\nEDCO’s full customer launch went live in May 2019. Today, EDCO’s product catalog\nis easily accessible online, customers are digitally enabled and EDCO’s team is\nmore efficient than ever.\n\nEDCO has seen more than 300 registered accounts. Over 1400 orders have run\nthrough Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud. But more importantly than accounts or\norder frequency, EDCO values the efficiency gain they’ve seen since\nincorporating Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud.\n\nCustomers are more empowered than ever before to self-serve. They can easily\ncheck inventory levels, pricing and account history. Because customers can\nconduct business on their own terms, EDCO believes their CSRs have been relieved\nof over 6,000 phone calls. As each phone call takes an average of 5 minutes,\nEDCO estimates that Optimizely Configured Commerce has saved CSRs more than 500\nhours of work.\n\nEDCO employees have even reported increased job satisfaction since incorporating\nOptimizely B2B Commerce Cloud. As the platform has freed salespeople up from\nentering orders or completing other simple tasks, they are now able to",

As the platform has freed salespeople up from\nentering orders or completing other simple tasks, they are now able to problem\nsolve and offer proactive, consultative guidance to customers. Overall,\nsalespeople enjoy their job even more.\n\nFinally, Optimizely B2B Commerce Cloud has helped the EDCO team onboard and\ntrain new employees. Training new employees by getting them acclimated with\nEDCO’s ERP can be complicated. An eCommerce system is easier to navigate and\noffers things like product images and descriptions which makes understanding the\nbreadth of EDCO products simpler.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nEDCO continues to put their customers first by consistently improving their\ncustomer experience. Looking ahead, EDCO wants to move even more orders online.\nThe team is also looking into making more technology improvements like\nincorporating EDI and updating their CRM.\n\nNo matter what changes, Arthur Edwards’ legacy will always live on. EDCO will\ncontinue delivering the highest quality product with a relentless focus on their\ncustomers. As Arthur once said, “We are never satisfied. We have to fulfill our\ndesire to make a better product line, a better company and hire more employees.”\n\n#### Industry\n\nManufacturing and distribution\n\n#### Product used\n\n- Configured Commerce\n\n#### Customer's website\n\nhttp://www.edcoinc.com/",
